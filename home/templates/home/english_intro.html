				 <h3>PREFACE.</h3>
				 <div class="line-sep"></div>
				 
<p>English language is a subject that has been for longtime lacking adequate and formal reference resources. Surprisingly teachers of this subject have been using inadequate and informal resources in facilitating it. 
<p>In adverse, it is with no doubt that most of these resources have witnessed factual inadequacy and in accuracy. This chain has been a great academic shame and embarrassment to teaching profession in our country.
vIt was with this gap and reason that immediately inspired the author to write this book and put it into record.
<p>The book covers a wide range of topics, including:  Introduction to language, word formation, Listening skills, Speaking skills, reading skills, Writing skills, as well as interpretation and translation. It is the intention of this book to provide and offer the required material to the extent that enables students to easily grasp, understand and interpret the content adaptively.
<p>Being comprehensive and elaborate enough, the teacher can also use this book as a guideline and students shall have a highly comprehensive skills of the English subject at the end of the course. More efforts have been made to ensure each chapter is demonstrated enough and easy for understanding.  
<p>In the course of reading this book, students shall find questions or Activities to do at the end of each topic; where there are review questions covering the aspects of the text material. Likewise, students are strongly a devised to read and answer all the questions set under each topic and subtopic in order that a teacher can assess or evaluate their masterly of the concerned topic or subject matter for which they have had introduced to in this book.
<p>The questions will also assist the teacher to identify and classify challenging areas, i.e. areas with difficulty. It is hence intended that this exercise, question or activity element will be stimulating and challenging to both the students and teachers. Therefore the approach is that there are questions at the end of each topic/subtopic.
 <p>In order to successful achieve the goal the teacher is advised to arrange or organize the students into groups of discussion as several as possible to facilitate and enhance students’ understanding and analytical capacity. It is through group discussions and practices that students and teachers may reach to the intended goal; hence developing students’ understanding of the subject matter.
<p>It is therefore expected that teachers, instructors and students will find the book useful.

						<h2>INTRODUCTION TO LANGUAGE </h2>
					</div>	
				
			<p>English is thought to be one of the most important languages in the world. There are many reasons why English is so important. One of the reasons is that English is spoken as the first language in many countries; there are 104 countries where English is spoken as the first language.  However, English is an international language as it is used in Europe, America, Asia, Australia and Africa. In Tanzania, particular, English is an official language of communication both nationally and internationally. On the other hand, it is a medium of instruction in secondary schools and higher learning institutions. In commerce, trade and international understanding, it plays an important role. Nevertheless, it is the language of science and technology. Without English it would be difficult for Tanzania to acquire much needed scientific and technical knowledge. Thus, learning and mastering English language is of great important in the today’s world.
<h3><a name="tml"></a></h3>
<p><span>The meaning of Language 
<p>The meaning that is understood is created and derived within the context of shared activities or public actions, not just in the minds of individual. When one speaks, he/she is not attaching a verbal sound as a label to something going on in his mind, rather he/she is using a verbal sound which has a function in communication and has a place in public behavior. There is no private meaning, Meaning occurs within social activities. It is However language itself which is being one of those activities.
<p>The term language however, has been seen by different experts who have been greatly concerned themselves in exploring the concept of language. The following are some of the explored meaning or definitions of the so-called language. 
<p>Language is the method of human communication, either spoken or written, consisting of the use of words in a structured and conventional way. (Chomsky, 1965)
<p>In this definition, language acts as a way or channel in which exchange of talks, information or ideas are taking through. 
<p>Language is a system that consists of the development, acquisition, maintenance and use of complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system (hymes, 1992).
<p>As seen from the above definitions, language which comprises several elements can be acquired-that means children after they are born, can start using the language as they are growing up (acquisition), again the acquired language can be developed in the sense that children come to understand and communicate language during early childhood. Language development reflects the growth and maturation of the brain.
<p>Language is a system of arbitrary vocal symbols by which speech sounds are conveyed from one person to another.
<p>From this definition, language is seen to consist several useful terms which are used in communication. These terms include system, arbitrary, vocal, symbols and conventional. However, clarification of each important term used in defining what is language, is given as follows.
<h3><a name="las"></a></h3>
<p><span>Language as a system 
<p>Language is a system and a complex as organs of the human body, the system of the body functions through different organs such as heart, lungs, brain, ears and eyes, these various organs are interconnected and work in coordination. Similarly the system of language functions through sound, words and structure. These are integrated with one another and constitute the complex organic whole which is language, for example the word come consists the sounds /k/, /˄/ and /m/, the sounds given bring meaning only if they are combined in their corresponding order.
<p>Language is therefore primarily made up of linguistic units which are combined to perform the common purpose (the same task) which is enhancing communication process.
<h3><a name="laarb"></a></h3>
<p><span>Language as an arbitrary
<p>Language is arbitrary because it has nothing intrinsically common to the information that it code. Take the word “rat” for example; why is it called so? May be the shape of rat’s head is similar to “R” letter and its legs look like “T” letter? Or maybe when they run, their nails click and produce a perfect “rat-rat-rat” sound? There is no reason to link the word “rat” to the actual animal other than people just got used to it. “Rat” referring to the actual rodent, is an arbitrary rather than the natural connection and language being arbitrary system allows for diversity and makes it as expressive and flexible as it is. In brief, language is arbitrary because there is no direct connection or association between the object and its meaning. Words are randomly chosen to represent certain meanings. 

<p><span>Language as vocal
<p>Considering language as a construction of vocal symbols, we actually want to distinguish oral from written language. Language is originally oral/ spoken (vocal symbols). In other words we can say that spoken language is the origin of written language. See this fact! Children grow up leaning and speaking language (orally) before learning to write. Clearly, language is said to be vocal because it is pronounced and that sound is given. It is vocal because it is produced by articulate sounds as opposed to written language. 

<p><span>Language as a symbol
<p>Language can be thought of as a system of communication that uses symbols to convey deep meaning. Symbols can be words, images, body language, sounds etc. Language is symbolic in more ways than can be summarized in a sentence or paragraph, but generally we are talking about how symbols can stand for something else, how they can be used to communicate and how they can be imbued with meaning.
<p>For a simple example of a symbolic language; the word “cat” is symbolic of the idea of a cat, a “dollar” is a symbol of $1 of economic value, the word “yes’ or a “nod” is a symbol of confirmation, a grimace is a symbol of disapproval and a smiley face is a symbol of happiness, that is why we consider language as symbolic because words area used to stand for something (things) else.

<h3><a name="laconv"></a></h3>
<p><span>Language as conventional 
<p>Conventional refers to what is generally expected by people based on what is common at a specific time, and in a specific culture. For example, if you were getting married, “a traditional” wedding dress based on someone’s culture might be red, but in the U.S, a “conventional” dress is floor-length and white. Language is conventional because there is formal agreement or contract among the speakers or language users on which words (symbols) to be used to convey or represent certain meanings. Conventional in language does with arbitrary where words are chosen without any principle or reason, but rather just through agreement or acceptance that certain words be used to represent certain meanings else.

<h3><a name="cohl"></a></h3>
<p><span>Characteristics of human language 
<p>Language is today an inseparable part of human society. Human civilization has been possible only through language. Language is human, so it differs from animal communication in several ways. Language can have scores of characteristics but the following are the most important ones;
<p>Language is arbitrary, productive, creative, displacement, cultural transmission, discreteness, duality, reflexiveness and interchangeability.
<p>However, these characteristics of language set human language apart from animal communication. Some of these features may be part of animal communication; yet they do not form part of it in total.

<p><span>Productivity and creativity 
<p>Language has creativity and productivity. The structural elements of human language can be combined to produce new utterances, which neither the speaker nor his hearers may ever have made or heard before. Language changes according to the needs of society. 
<p>For example; the –lysuffix can be added to many adjectives to create new adverbs, nice becomes “nicely” while able becomes “ably” that is a productive pattern. Another example, Tanzania is a linguist’s incubator this sentence may be new to people who have ever yet heard the sentence before.

<p><span>Arbitrariness 
<p>Language is arbitrary in the sense that there is no inherent relation between the words of a language and their meanings or the ideas conveyed by them. For example, there is no reason why a female adult human being be called a “woman” in English, “Zen” in Persian and femine in French. The choice of a word selected to mean a particular thing or idea is purely arbitrary but once a word is selected for a particular referent, it comes to stay as such. It may be noted that had language not been arbitrary, there would have been only one language in the world

<p><span>Duality 
<p>Duality Refers to the two systems of sound and meaning, these two system are known as two levels of language (sound and meaning). For example, at the sound level, sounds like /t/. /I/,/e/ and /d/. When these sounds are arranged in a certain proper order like /deIt/ as in Date, we get meaning and hence giving us another level (meaning level).

<p><span>Displacement 
<p>Displacement is one of the distinct properties of human language. it is a characteristic of language that allows users to talk about things and events other than those occurring in the here and now. For example when your pet cat comes home and stands at your feet calling meow, you are likely to understand this message as relating to that immediate time and place. If any ask your cat where it has been and what it has been up to, you will probably get the same meow response.
<p>Animal communication seems to be designed exclusively for this moment here and now, it cannot effectively be used to relate events that are far removed in time and place. 
<p>When your dog says GRRR, it means GRRR, right now, because dogs do not seem to be capable of communicating GRRR, last night, over in the park. In contrast, human language users are normally capable of producing messages equivalent to GRRR, last night, over in the park. Humans can refer to past and future time. This property is called displacement. Indeed displacement allows us to talk about things and places. For example, angles, fairies, superman, heaven and hell, whose existence we cannot even be sure of.

<p><span>Cultural transmission
<p>Cultural transmission is generally regarded as one of the key characteristics in distinguishing human language from animal communication. In cultural transmission, language is passed on from one generation to the next in a community. It is also known as cultural learning and socio/cultural transmission. For example, while we may inherit physical features such as brown eyes and dark hair from our parents, we do not inherit their language. We acquire language in culture with other speakers and not from parent genes. This marks the so called cultural transmission in language.

<!-- <h3><a name="dohl"></a></h3>
<p><span>Discreteness of human language 
<p>A major difference between animal language and human language is the discreteness of human language. This refers to the uniqueness of the sounds used in human languages. Every language uses a set of different sounds. Each of these sounds is different from the rest and is combined to form new meaning. A sound can be repeated, or combined with another to form a new meaning. But animal languages do not have this feature of discreteness. Discreteness means sounds that are meaningfully distinct for example, the pronunciation of pack and back leads to distinction of meaning and that is only due to uniqueness of language. In human beings, individual sounds can be observed. For example, /k/, /a/ /i/ and /t/ - three sounds. These sounds can be heard they can also be segmented that means /k/ /a/ and /t/ to form cat. -->

<p><span>Interchangeability 
<p>In the daily communication, people do send and receive messages. Speakers become hearers/listeners and in turn the same hearers/listeners become speakers at a time point. This act marks the so-called interchangeability in language which is also known as reciprocity. Interchangeability involves exchange of talks among the speakers. Interchangeability refers to the idea that humans can give and receive identical language signals.
<p>In other words, anything that one can here, one can also say.  However, not all species poses this feature, only human beings possess this attribute; since he/she is able to exchange talks in conversations.

<p><span>Reflexiveness
<p>Human being is found of talking about language; surprisingly, in talking about language, language is used. This entails the so termed reflexiveness. Thus, reflexiveness is using language to talk about language itself. The language used to describe about language is usually called meta-language. Reflexiveness contends that in language the speaker can use his/her language to talk about language. Speakers of language are able to have knowledge about their language and be able to reflect up on it.

<p><span>ACTIVITY 1.1
<p>Language is said to be for human being. Discuss. 
<p>Why is human language an arbitrary? 
<p>Do animals have a language?
<p>How language undergoes creativity?
<p>In the use of language, some people are seen to have mastered it while some are seen not to be as those language experts. However there are aspects that assist us to evaluate or assess as to what extend a person understands a language. These aspects include competence and performance.

<p><span>Competence </span></p>
			
		
<p>Language competence is a broad term which includes linguistic or grammatical competence, discourse competence, sociolinguistic or socio-cultural competence and what might be called textual competence. The specific learning outcomes under language competence deal with knowledge of the language and the ability to use that knowledge to interpret and produce meaningful texts appropriate to the situation in which they are used. In short competence involves knowing language. Language competence is best developed in the context of activities or tasks where the language is used for real purposes. In other words; in practical applications. Competence likewise, involves the use and mastery of language. Competence enables the speaker to judge between correct and incorrect language patterns or structures. For example, when someone says, I meet Apolo yesterday; the other will easily realize that, it should be I met Apolo yesterday. This is therefore language competence.

<br>
<h3><a name="perfom"></a></h3>



			<p><span>Perfomance</span></p>
			
			
<p>The term language performance was used by Noam Chomsky in 1960 to describe the actual use of language in concrete situations. It is used to describe both the production, sometimes called parole, as well as the comprehension of language. Performance is defined in opposition to competence. The latter (competence) describes the mental knowledge that a speaker or listener has of language. Performance entails doing something with language. In performance, the speaker is compelled to choose right words appropriate (suitable) for the right situation.
<p>However competence and performance relate to each other, this is because the error exhibited through performance can easily be corrected through competence that is why performance is always being preceded by competence.
<h3><a name="impli"></a></h3>
Implications of competence and performance 
<p>As we have learned, competence and performance involves “knowing” and “doing”.  However, competence and performance have some implications in the language use. One of the implications is that competence and performance as part of learning language, helps the learners to best internalize the forms. The assumption here is that once the learners have learned the information, they will be able to use it through reading, writing listening and speaking.
<p>Again competence and performance allows a more accurate measure of learners’ language proficiency. This is because of the communicative approach used (performance) and language knowledge (competence).
<p>Also competence and performance ensures one’s ability to use the language in a certain contexts. Communicative competence includes the knowledge about the grammatically aspect, linguistics competence as well as how we use this knowledge of grammar in our actual speech comprehension (linguistic performance).
<p>Likewise, competence and performance promotes our ability to make sentences and to understand it. It also equips us with our knowledge of what belongs to sentences and what does not in a language. For example, English native speakers might know the concept and the meaning of sentence;“I go to school every day” but it would not be acceptable if the sentence becomes “I go to school yesterday.” even it is still in English sentence but is unacceptable.
<p>This therefore, entails that language is rule-governed. That is why language users are able to determine between correct and incorrect language use; simply because we can realize that some language items (rules) has been violated (broken). Similarly, language users can identify incorrect and correct sentences or words.
<p>However, in language, performance do not determine language competence, that is simply because a competent person in language may face some difficulties or problems of speaking, talking or uttering the words/sentences in a language due to some unavoidable factors like illness, slip of the tongue, lack of teeth, tiredness, drunkenness, unmotivated mood etc. so what language users produce is actually less than their linguistic stores.  i.e. what they have in their heads. 
<p>In order to focus learners more on the “doing” a part of learning (performance) and linguistic competence, which allows a more accurate measure of learners’ language proficiency, a more communicative approach and linguistic knowledge approach to teaching can be used. These types of approaches concentrate on getting learners to “doing” and “knowing” things with the language. This should be by encouraging students to eventually “learn through the language” as opposed to strictly learning the language; there is a more balanced focus on both competence and performance. 

ACTIVITY 1.2

3.	Relate between linguistic performance and linguistic competence
4.	Why is competence and performance useful in language? 
5.	Identify and discuss the four main types of linguistic expressions.

Functions of Language 
<p>Language is the most important tool of communication invented by human civilization. Language helps us share our thought and understand others. It is hard to overestimate the importance of language for our lives. Every time we speak, we do it with a particular purpose. Sometimes we want to deliver a message or express our feelings. We use language to ask for help, or just to say a joke. 
<p>Generally, there are many functions of language, but the common or main functions include informational (communicative) function, aesthetic function, expressive function, phatic function and directive functions. Any language is determined by a number of factors, such as social background, attitudes and origin of people. Language is always related to situation it is used within. Every person has a certain social background and this is what determines one’s language. 
<p>We are going to consider different functions of language and its connection to social circumstances, since language is related to the type of social organization. 
<p>As we mentioned above, language is used in every part of our lives and it is the most important language part of communication. We use language in every situation, every time we need something. In turn, our needs determine our language, since we choose a type of language that is most effective for our needs.
<p>Every our sentence has its particular function. It may express a statement, or a question. It also may be just an exclamation.  If we want to know something we create a sentence in the form of a question. In other case, if we want to share information or emotions, we choose a statement structure.
There are common functions of language. We mentioned all these five functions at the beginning. Now, let us take a closer look at each one of them


1.	Informational/communicative function
<p>The informational function can be considered most important since it helps us deliver message, describe things and give our listener new information. Actually message is a world that describes this function best. The informational or communicative function is also related to such terms as a truth and a value.
2.	Expressive function 
<p>The next function of language is the expressive function. We need such function every time we want to express our feeling. There are words that are used to express attitudes and feelings which do not deliver any particular information. Obvious examples of such words are swear words as well as various exclamations. This function of language is used to deliver a message, but to express feelings and impressions. Due to the expressive function of language, we can understand the personality o the speaker and his or her emotions. Expressive function is used in literature and poetry. Every time for example, we say a phrase like “I love this movie so much” we do not give a listener any particular information about the subject of this sentence except our feelings about it.
3.	Directive function/instrumental function 
<p>The directive function of language is used to indicate certain actions or reactions; the example of such a function is a command. Another example of this function is a request. Here affective and situational meanings of a phrase are more important than a general meaning, which makes this function somewhat similar to the expressive function. The directive function is a function of social control and interpersonal interaction. Another feature of this function is that the reaction of a listener is even more important than a thought expressed by a speaker, since this reaction determines whether such a phrase achieved the target or not.
<p>Every time we ask someone to bring us something. It is a directional use of language. we motivate somebody and influence his or her behavior in a certain way. Sometimes directive sentences may express more than one function. For example, if we say “I am hungry.” it means both information about us and a request for food. This sentence also expresses our feelings, so this example represents three functions of language in one short sentence.
4.	Aesthetic function 
<p>This function does not have any particular purpose. Here words and sentences are considered as linguistic artifacts. This function serves neither as a request nor as a message. The aesthetic function helps us use words as a tool of a poetic art and as certain signs. Here the beauty of choosing words and phrases is more important than usefulness of this information. for the sake of such a function, we use different adjectives such as “gorgeous”, “elegant”, “stunning” and so on. According to Jacobson (1993), who studied this function of language in detail, the aesthetic function depends not only on structure, but also on cultural norms as well. He also gives an example of such influence, comparing poems of Karel Macha and diaries as examples of aesthetic functions applied by different generations.
5.	Phatic function/interactional function 
<p>The only purpose of such a function is to maintain social relationships and to begin or continue the conversation. The Phatic function is language for the sake of interaction and is therefore, associated with the contact/Channel factor. The Phatic function can be observed in greetings and casual discussions of the weather, particularly with strangers. It also provides the keys to open, maintain, verify or close the communication channel. “Hello?”, “OK?”, “Hummm,” “Bye” etc.
6.	Metalingual function/glossing function
<p>The metalingual, alternatively called metalinguistic or reflexive function is the use of language what Jacobs calls “code” to discuss or describe itself. In short metalinguistic function is the use of language to talk or describe about language itself. For example, using language to talk about functions of language, using language to talk about language structures and patterns, the word noun is a noun etc.
7.	Regulatory function 
<p>Language is used to influence the behaviour of others. It deals with persuading, commanding requesting other people to do things one wants. In other words it is used to tell others what to do. it resembles to directive function but its only difference is that unlike directive which does with directing and commanding a certain reaction, regulatory goes further with persuading.


8.	The poetic function/aesthetic function 
<p>When the speaker focuses on the message for its own sake, the poetic function is put to use. This function encompasses more than poetry. For example, euphony, i.e. pleasantness of speech and pronunciation, is an application of this function. This poetic function of language can be used when one says “Alexander the great”. Instead of the great Alexander which essentially has the same meaning. Poetic function involves play with form like rhyme, repetitions, alliteration assonance, and juxta position of paronyms – word derived from the same root as another word with phonetic similarity-“folly” and “fool” “fish the fissure for fish”. Spoonerisms –our queer clean for our dear queen. It also involves play with meaning. “You cannot feature in a future you cannot picture” this is aesthetical function etc.
9.	Personal function 
<p>In personal function, we use language to express the personal preferences and identity of the speaker, language is used to express feelings, opinions and individual identity. It is sometimes referred to as the “here I am!” or intra-personal function or emotive function-announcing oneself to the world. This function emphasizes the addresser’s own attitudes towards the content of the message. That is it looks at the emotion of the speaker towards the message content. The intent of the addresser in constructing a message is emotive in the sense that, no matter how literal the message might be, its mode of delivery invariably involves the latent presence of the addresser’s emotions, attitudes, social status etc., when a speaker does not speak to convey an item of information, but express their feelings, the communication is more for the speaker more than for the people who may (or may not) hear him/her.

Roles of Language 
<p>Language plays a very important role in human lives. It is a social phenomenon. one of the main goal of language is to communicate with people and understand them. When someone speaks, he intends a specific purpose. He wants to convey a message through the language.
<p>But the question comes how or why do you say something? Do you even relay the same message to different people in different ways? This part discusses the roles of language in interaction between people and how language and its functions influence each other. again it is roles of language that determines the functions of language. Consequently, it is those language functions that determine the importance o language. The following are the different roles of language in the community.
<p><span>1.	Language as a factor for social stratification
<p>Classes in the society determine the language use. Class, ethnicity and gender are three social factors that play a role in language variation. Class is the structure of relationships between groups where people are classified based on the Education, occupation and income.
<p>Ethnicity refers to a group of people that share cultural characteristics and gender deals with the traits associated with men and women. Class, ethnicity and gender influences language variation. Ethnic groups affect language variation because they usually have to learn the language that is prominent in an area. Although they view language as a part of their identity, they have to compromise their language and substitute it with another or combine both languages.
<p>Gender affects language variation by influencing the language choice between men and women. A man and a woman’s speech differ from one another in matters of degree. Men’s language can be direct, non-standard and aggressive. Women’s language can be less harsh, emotional and standard. Many languages have alternative forms that are used only by men or women. In some cases the men and women speak different dialects or they don’t speak the same language to each other.
<p><span>2.	Language as a reflection of culture
<p>Culture affects language giving rise and words, influencing their use and providing context. Language, in turn, supports culture, promoting social bonds and allowing for shared information. In this part we explore the relationship between language and culture. 
<p>Culture is intrinsic to language, language relates common experiences and backgrounds and these histories, in turn, create words specific to our culture. Have you ever been in a group of people talking about shared experiences; and something is said, that makes nonsense to you, while everyone else laughs? This inside joke makes you feel excluded and shows how the shared experience of culture affects meaning. Understanding the words without understanding the culture may not be enough for comprehension. Language is not only words but also pronunciations, tone and particular dialects all of these parts of a language are shared by culture.
<p><span>3.	Language as a medium of communication 
<p>Language is the human capacity of acquiring and using of complex system of communication. Language is the medium for interaction, exchanging ideas, understanding feelings of others and for the development of the human race existing on this planet. The only medium or the basic element that comes in use for understanding It is the language that we speak; makes us understand and allows us to live in peace and harmony by understanding the feelings and problems of other by exchange of talks on the desk of peace. Language is a medium through which a person delivers his/her ideas to the world. Learning a language is all about knowing how to communicate with a different section of people on the other side of the world.
<p><span>4.	Language as a factor for national identity
<p>National identity refer to the sense of belonging to ne state or nation, rather than another, it is far from natural phenomenon. It rather requires the presence of a number of symbols of various kinds, which people can identify with. These can include flags, songs, colours, the national’s history (particularly the national creation myth), culture, food etc.
<p>A common language is a very potent symbol. For that reason, nations tries to encourage or even enforce use of the national language, with varying degrees of success that is why it is easy to know whether a person is from a certain country, nation or state. For example, if a person is heard speaking French language, one will directly realize that he/she is from France. This is according to the historical fact that French language is spoken in France. Again, if a person is heard speaking Kiswahili language, one will know that he/she is from Tanzania or one of the east African countries.
<p><span>5.	Language as a factor for development 
<p>People communicate using language to link various businesses/tasks. For example, people use language to link or connect international matters, exchanging ideas, as a medium of instruction to students (in education matters) like English language in Tanzania for secondary school students and higher learning institutions and Kiswahili for primary school students. Again human language is used in trade, in commerce and also people use language in science and technology like English language which is considered the language for science and technology. Leaders also use language to influence people to perform a certain task which is for society benefits, thus regarding all of these, language is considered as the factor for development.
<p><span>6.	Language as a unifying factor
<p>When people/culture/tribe share a language, it sets them apart as part of the world where they speak and understand what is said and the idioms that are understood are like an inside joke shared by them and unifying them in their comfort with language. Telling jokes, debating points of honour or ethics, teaching knowledge, preaching the philosophy or religion from one generation to another makes a bond that does not always include others from outside. In Tanzania for example, Kiswahili has assisted us in unifying people. Since they feel together or united through the use of common language (Kiswahili).

<p><span>Activity 1.3 
<p>1.	With vivid example explain what language does.
<p>2.	Identify and explain the importance of language resulting from its functions. 
<p>3.	Why is language said to perform phatic function?

<h3><a name="blco"></a></h3>
<p><span>Basic Language Concepts 
<p>In order to function with language in the society, one needs to learn the rules and structures of the language system. One structure of language that helps people to become more specific in their understanding and use of language is the knowledge of concepts.
<p>It is important for language users to have a good understanding of different concepts as it assists in their ability to follow instructions and be specific in what they are talking about, here language users should involve themselves with the study of language (linguistics). Another, in order for language users to use concepts in their language, they first need to have a good understanding about what these concepts are and what they mean. by developing this understanding they are then better able to use language effectively.
<p>Likewise, there are various language concepts that are important in understanding language. These include the following.
	<ul>
<li><span>Accent</span></li>
<p>An accent is a manner of pronunciation peculiar to a particular individual, location or nation. An accent may be identified with the locality in which its speakers reside (a regional or geographical accent); the socio-economic status of its speakers, their ethnicity, their caste or social class (a social accent) or influence from their first language (a foreigner accent). Accent typically differs in equality of the voice, pronunciation and distinction of vowels and consonants, stress and prosody. Although grammar, semantics, vocabulary and other language characteristics often vary concurrently with accent, the word “accent” may refer specifically to the differences in pronunciation, where as the word “dialect “encompasses the broader set of linguistic differences. Often accent is a subset of “dialect”.
<p>Accent is a distinctive way of pronouncing a language, especially one associated with a particular country, area or social class. For example, a strong American English accent, British English accent, Indian English accent, Nigerian English accent etc. </p>
<li><span>Dialect </span>
<p>Dialect refers to a variety of language that is a characteristic of a particular group of the language’s speakers. Under this definition the dialects or varieties of a particular language are closely related and, despite their differences, are most often largely mutually intelligible, especially if close to one another on the dialect continuum. The term is applied most often to regional speech patterns, but a dialect may be defined by other factors, such as social class or ethnicity. A dialect that is associated with a particular social class can be termed as a sociolect, a dialect that is associated with a particularly ethnic group can be termed as ethnolect; and a regional dialect may be termed a regiolect. According to this definition any variety of a given language constitutes a “dialect, including any standard varieties. In this case, the distinction between the “standard language” i.e. the standard dialect of a particular language and the non “standard” dialect of the same language is often arbitrary and based on social, political, cultural or historical considerations. Dialect may also refer to the variation of language according to user. In dialect people speaking the same language may differ in terms of linguistic backgrounds or characteristics such as pronunciation, grammar, spelling and vocabulary.
</p>
</ul
<p><span>Types of Dialect</span></p> 
	<ol>
<li><span>	Social dialect </span></li>
<p>A social dialect, which is sometimes called a sociolect dialect is a variety of language (a register) used by a socioeconomic class, a profession, an age group or other social group. It is a variety of language spoken by a particular group based on social characteristics other than geography.
<li><span>	Idiolect/individuality</span></li>
<p>Idiolect is an individual’s way of using a language. It is the individual’s language habits that distinguish one user from another user speaking or using the same language. A speaker of the language can be identified just by listening to his/her sound (voice). Even if he/she is not physically seen, It is idiolect that makes you say that is “Nyerere speaking” even if he is speaking in an audio CD.
<li><span>	Regional dialect </span></li>
<p>A regional dialect is a distinct form of language spoken in a particular geographical area. It is also known as a regiolect or topolect as opposed to a national dialect, a regional dialect is spoken in one particular area of a country. In the USA for example, regional dialects include Appalachian, new jersey and southern English; and in Britain cockney, Liverpool English and “Geordie” (New Castle English). So British English and American English are two major examples of English dialect, these dialects differs in spelling, vocabulary and grammar. Consider the following example which shows differences between British and American English.

<p><span>Miscellaneous differences
<p>There are some miscellaneous differences between the British and American English as follows.
<p>(a)	Rendering of dates
<p>In American English, the convention of having the month preceding the date is followed. For example, April 17, 2018 is written and abbreviated as 4/17/2018. In British English, however, the date precedes the month. Thus, April 17,2018, is written and abbreviated as 17/4/2018.
<p>(b)	Telling of time 
<p>There are some minor differences in the telling of time where as one would usually say “half past five” in American English, our British colleagues will say “half five”.
<p>The difference between British and American English as seen is reflected in the use of vocabulary, grammar, spelling, pronunciation and punctuation. Although they may seem minor to a native English speaker, they are still challenging for the English language learners.

<p><span>Registers  
<p>Registers often refer to the degree of formality of language; but in a more general sense it means the language used by a group of people who share similar work or interests, such as doctors and lawyers, register is a variation of language according to use. For example in education, medicine court, church, mosque, market etc. in the classroom, although register is a complex area, the most common aspect looked at in a language learning is the degree of formality. Teachers often divide functional language into three working categories, formal, neutral and informal.
<p>(a)	Formal 
A formal register is neither colloquial nor personal and is the register that is mostly used in academic writing. It is a register where strong opinions can be expressed objectively; it does not break any of the rules of written grammar and often has a set of rules of what not to do when using this register. It includes business letters, letters of complaint, some essays, reports, official speeches, announcements, professional emails etc. 
<p>(b)	Informal register
<p>Generally, journalism and occasionally academic writing use this register. When using an informal register, there is usually a close relationship between the writer, audience and topic with a degree of casualness. However, care must be taken in order not to mistake informal for familiar register. The features of this register are different from the familiar register as more care is taken with grammar etc. However the tone is conversational using colloquial language compared to the formal register. It also includes slang and cliches, short sentences, incomplete sentences, jokes acronyms, symbols and abbreviations.
<p>(c)	Familiar register 
<p>This register is normally used between people who know each other well.  Features of this register show a lack of grammar, spelling, and pronunciation. It usually contains slang and jargons. For example, hey, will arrive evening. Did not catch bus. Later, John.
<p>(d)	Neutral register 
<p>The neutral register is non-emotional and sticks to facts. It is most appropriate for technical writing; neutral writing (register) is not necessarily formal or informal. It is not usually positive or negative. It is used to deliver facts. The neutral language register include, for example, reviews, articles, some letters, some essays, technical writing etc.

<p><span>Causes of Language Variation in the community</span></p>
<p>John Is an English learner form Mexico. Very often, john chooses to say things like “He don’t know” or “I didn’t do nothing!” When John’s English language learning teacher corrects these mistakes, John says he knows what he is saying is wrong. However, john says that is how his friends speak. This example illustrates the definition of language variation. This is the choice of language a speaker or writer makes in order to express ideas. Language variation happens mostly because there is no a single way to say things in a language. However, the way in which a speaker or writer expresses ideas has to do with specific factors.  Let us explore them.
<p>The factors that influence a speaker’s or writer’s choice of language (language variation) vary and they include the context that surrounds the speaker or writer, the age, gender, culture, social classes, geographical differences, occupation, ethnic backgrounds etc. very often the choice of language is conscious and the speaker can switch the language choice depending on such factors. Let’s look at them through some example.
<p>i)	Context
<p>When Hamis is with his friends who speak English in the neighborhood, he uses words like ‘cool’ awesome and buddy. However, when Hamis speaks to his teachers at school, he consciously makes an effort to use words that sound appropriate to his teachers, such as nice, sir and madam. Something similar happens when Hamis has to write. If he writes a text message to a friend, he knows he can use abbreviations like “lol”. Conversely, if Hamis writes an email to a teacher, he knows that “lol” is not right for the context of relationship. In short this example shows how the context in which a speaker or writer expresses ideas has an influence on the language variation or choice of words and expressions. Thus, it is not surprise that English learners or English users in general choose different language variations depending on where they are or who they speak or write for.
<p>ii)	Speaker’s age/age differences 
<p>Juma leaves behind his teenage years and becomes an adult; he slowly leaves behind the old ways of expression he used to have for both oral and written discourse. For example as Juma joins college, he gets used to more formal ways of expressions with people. When he greets people he no longer feels comfortable saying “Hey… what’s up? Instead he prefers “Hi, good morning”. This is not just also because Juma is in college; this is also because Juma is now more mature and he spontaneously feels more comfortable using more formal language. In short age can determine how language learners or language users express themselves; and you, as a teacher can easily see the difference in language variation if you teach a class of children as opposed to a class of adult learners.
<p>iii)	Gender/sex 
<p>As a guy, Baraka feels comfortable using certain words to his male buddies. However, when he speaks to girls, Baraka chooses words he would not use with his male friends. Partly, Baraka does this because his behaviour around the opposite sex is different than among his friends of the same sex. Also, Baraka does this because he unconsciously knows that females themselves use different language than males. In short, gender also influences the expressions, word choice, intonation and tone in the language. 

<p>iv)	Ethnic background 
<p>Ethnic groups affect language variation, because they usually have to learn the language that is prominent in an area. Although they view language as part of their identity, they have to compromise their languages and substitute it with another, or combine both languages. Ethnic groups learn the dominant language in an area where the majority of the people speak that language, their variety of the dominant language is called the “substrate”, because it shows the differences between it and their language. Immigrants who arrive in a new location quickly learn the dominant language. Their language is called the “adstrate” and it affects the way they speak the dominant language and it differs from the normal version of the language.
<p>An ethnic group is however a category of people who identify with each other based on similarities such as common ancestry, language, history, society, culture or nation. Ethnicity is usually an inherited status based on the society in which one lives.  Membership of an ethnic group tends to be defined by a shared cultural heritage, ancestry, origin, myth, history, homeland, language or dialect. Symbolic systems such as, religion, mythology and rituals; cuisine, dressing style, art and physical appearance.
<p>v)	Social classes
<p>The use of standard and non-standard dialect often reflects speakers’ social class. Upper class tend to speak standard dialect, middle class try to speak standard language and sometimes try to speak more standard dialect; because they hope to move to a higher class. Lower classes tend to speak non-standard dialects and their grammar and pronunciation is poor uncompared to the upper and the middle classes.
<p>vi)	Occupations
<p>Occupations are an important feature of society. Any analysis of how the society works is likely to consider occupation. These are a very common feature of social organization, more or less universal in economically developed societies and throughout recorded history. Occupations could not really exist without language, especially those in which many people work together and need to pass on information about how to do things or about current tasks.
<p>Occupations develop their own special language features and use those of the common language in novel or distinctive ways. Occupations are source of language variation. People working together in the same field/occupation tend to use their distinctive way of language that is different from other people’s occupation. For example doctors, teachers, nurses, lawyers, politicians, pastors etc. these people use language, each quite different from others due to different occupations; hence causing or influencing language variation.
<p>vii)	Geographical dispersion
<p>Geographical dispersion or differences is one of the factors causing or influencing language variation, however, people from one geographical area may differ in terms of choice of words of the language to be used in conversation or writing with the speakers from other places else. For example, an English speaker from America may differ with an English speaker from Britain in the choice of words and use of language, this is however, due to lack of close contacts as caused by some factors like distances etc. To verify this consider this example, an English speaker from America will prefer the use of “will” in the sentence  while an English speaker from Britain will prefer the use of “shall” in the sentence.

<p><i>For example;</i></p>
<p>American English speaker: “I will” go home
<p>British English speaker: “I shall” go home. 
<p>The above example illustrates really that geographical dispersion influences language variation.

<p><span>Pidgin 
<p>As we have seen at accents, dialects and registers as language concepts and as language varieties; let us pay our attention to pidgin, then we shall have a look on the creoles as also language varieties.
<p>A pidgin likewise is a language that has developed from a mixture of two languages.  It is used as a means of communication by people who do not speak each other’s language; for example, English, French etc. when it is spoken in a simple way by someone who does not speak that language well, consider the following example, “He come here”. 
<p>This is such an example which is asked in Pidgin English.
<p>Pidgin as an auxiliary language has come into existence through the attempts by the speakers of the two different languages to communicate and that is primary a simplified forms of one of the language with a reduced vocabulary and considerable variation in pronunciation.
<p>Pidgin as a language is made up of elements of two more other languages and used for contacts, between the speakers  of other languages, unlike creoles, pidgin do not constitute the mother tongue of any speech community.
<p>Pidgin is a broader concept, however it refer to a loosely any simplified or broken form of language especially when it used for communication between speakers of different languages. 
<p>Pidgin entails the simplified form of speech formed out of one or more existing language and used as a lingua-Franca by people who have no other language in common. It is also known as pidgin language or auxiliary language.
<p>Examples of English pidgins include 
<p>-	Capeverde English pidgin – Portuguese
<p>-	Nigerian pidgin English 
<p>-	Hawatian pidgin English 
<p>-	Queensland kahaka English
<p>-	Bislama pidgin English etc. 
<p>-	Tok pisin – pretty developed English pidgin on papa new Guinea
<p>Once a pidgin has come into existence, it develops further with respect to its grammatical structure and range of communicative functions, these developments depends on the communicative needs of the pidgins speakers. Here, pidgins may reveal a developmental continuum. There are particular stages of pidgins development which are universal for all pidgins; the stages are characterized by differing degrees of stability and complexity in the pidgin grammar and in the communicative functions the pidgin serves.
<p>These stages of pidgins include jargon, tertiary, hybridization, stable pidgin (tertiary hybrid) and extended or expanded pidgin.

<p><span>Types of Pidgin 
<p>a)	Temporal pidgin 
<p>Because of their limited functions, pidgin languages usually do not last very rarely more than several decades. They disappear when the reason for communication diminishes as communities either moves apart, one community learns the language of the other or both communities learn a common language usually the official language of the country. For instance, Russian pidgin spoken in Manchuria disappeared when settlers left china after World War II. The same is true to French pidgin which disappeared from Vietnam after the French left the country. 
<p>However, this is what we term as temporal pidgin. It is the pidgin language that lasts for a very short time, since it arises just to fulfill some communicative needs among the two people speaking different language.
<p>b)	Expanded/extended pidgin 
<p>Typically pidgin functions as lingua Franca or means for intergroup communication; but not as vernaculars which are usually defined as language varieties used for ordinary interactions that occur outside a business context. In short here we see that pidgin can be used in areas where many language are spoken. This act in which a pidgin is thought to serve communicative purpose among people belonging to different ethnic language is what is termed extended/expanded pidgin. Expanded/extended pidgin is therefore defined as a pidgin (language) developed in an area where many languages are spoken. An example of expanded pidgin is Tokpisin-pretty developed English pidgin.

<p>Characteristics of Pidgin
<p>Compared to their source language, pidgins show a characteristic simplification of linguistics structure that concerns all aspects of grammar, lexicon, phonology, syntax, semantic, morphology etc. Accordingly, the grammar of pidgins is characteristically less complex than the grammar of their source language. 


<p><i>These characteristics of pidgins include the following</i></p>
<ol> 
<li><p>Pidgins reveal a lack of surface grammatical complexity. 
<li><p>	Pidgins are characterized by a lack of morphological complexity
<li><p>	Pidgins show a general preference for semantic transparency.
<li><p>	Pidgins show a characteristic (reduction in vocabulary) 
<li><p>	Pidgins are characterized by a comparatively high degree of phonological simplicity.
</ol>
<p>These features are shared by pidgins and creoles wide. Usually, contact language show structural similarities even though they are geographically widely separated and are based on different lexifier language which themselves does not share the structural features that are common to pidgins and creoles.

<p><span>Why use of Pidgins?
<p>Pidgins make communication easier in a multilingual speech community. There are various forms of languages in the world and it is impossible for an individual to be proficient in all these languages.
<p>Pidgin is commonly used during conversations among the students because most of the conversations done in the academic environment are usually formal, thereby creating some restrictions for the students as they tend to carefully select words in order not to bypass the rigorous processes of the standard language, for example, English language.


<p><span>Creoles 
<p>A Creole is believed to arise when a pidgin, developed by adults for use as a second language becomes the native and primary language of their children; a process known as nativization.
<p>A Creole language or simply Creole is a stable natural language developed from a mixture of different languages at a fairy sudden point in time, often a pidgin transitioned into a full, native language.
<p>Creoles also differ from pidgins in that while a pidgin has a highly simplified linguistic structure that develops as a means of establishing communication between two or more disparate language groups. a Creole language is more complex, used for day to day purposes in a community and acquired by children as a native language. Creole language, therefore have a fully developed vocabulary and system of grammar. Creole share more grammatically similarities with each other than with language from which they are derived.
<p>Examples of creoles includes
<ul> 
<p>-	Creoles based on Arabic 
<p>-	Chinese creoles 
<p>-	Malay based Creole language 
<p>-	Haitian Creole. The Creole with largest number of speakers with almost ten million native speakers.
<p>-	Dutch based Creole language 
<p>-	French based Creole language 
<p>-	Hindi based Creole 
<p>-	Japanese based Creole
<p>-	Spanish based Creole languages
<p>-	Portuguese based Creole language
</ul>
<p><span>Characteristics/features of Creoles </span></p>
<ul>
<p>- Creoles have a fully developed vocabulary and system of grammar uncompared to pidgins.
<p>- Creole languages are more complex than pidgins which are simplified languages.
<p>- Creoles are used for day-to-day communications.
<p>- Creoles are stable natural languages
<p>- Creole are pidgins transitioned into a native languages.

<p><span>National Language</span></p> 
<p>National language is probably the term that is more commonly used when talking about a language which is spoken in a specific country. Factually, however the term national language has some type of connection between a territory and a language spoken there. 
<p>It is difficult to determine what a national language is as it is to say what a nation is. 
<p>National language can mean that it is used in a specific region that may or may not coincide with the borders of a nation. 
<p>It can b e a tongue shared by a number of people , possibly citizens of the country or it can be used as a communication tool  between different groups within one nation, the last option is that a national language is the one used by the government in official business. For example, Kiswahili in Tanzania is a national language. However, this is the definition that is most often confused with the term “official language”.

<h3><a name="ola"></a></h3>
<p><span>Official Language </span></p>
<p>Official language is a bit more of a precise term. It is used to refer to a language that is given specific legal standing; this can apply to the whole country or a specific area. Most often are the ones that are used by the government since it is almost impossible to regulate by law what language people use to communicate to each other. Official languages are mostly related to the government of the country.
<p>It refers to what languages are used in the courts and by the administrators of the country. Official languages are also the ones that are often expressly mentioned in constitution and which serve as symbolic purpose. For example in many African countries the indigenous language are often given official status to promote their use.

<h3><a name="tdasbnaola"></a></h3>

<p><span>The differences and similarities between national and official language</span></p>
<p>National and official language both deal with the status of language in a certain territory. They are both legal categories that remain slightly poorly defined, leading to confusion and overlap. Both are commonly determined in constitutions of countries.
<p>In broad terms, national language refers to the tongue spoken in a certain territory, usually a nation-state, but always by one or several groups of people. Official languages are the ones used by a region or Government for official purposes. It has to do with day-to-day bureaucracy. Official languages can also be determined with the aim of promoting their use throughout the territory. 
<p>For example, Singapore has four official languages. English, Malay, mandarin and Tamil but only one of them is also the national language- Malay. 
<p>Tanzania is also having two official languages, Kiswahili and English but only one is the national language – Kiswahili. 

<h3><a name="sla"></a></h3>
<p><span>Standard Language </span></p>
<p>Standard language may be defined either as a language variety used by population for public purposes or as a variety that has undergone standardization. This language variety is mostly spoken in the commerce and government.
<p>Standard language sometimes known as standard variety is a predominant dialect chosen to be a literary form in order to make communication and other aspects of region/ country.
<p>Standard language is a language chosen to be used as a means of communication in the government business or official matters, for example, Kiswahili in Tanzania is used for public communications and government official matters. Likewise, British English and American Standard English are examples of standard dialect of English language.
<p><span>Characteristics of standard English</span></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Standard English is spoken in schools teaching English and as such is only spoken by the students learning English.
<li><p>It is characterized by the use of good grammar, stilted speech and lack of colloquialism.
<li><p>Standard English has also distinctive features of vocabulary and orthography, Spelling and pronunciation; this is because it can be spoken with any accent.
<li><p>Standard English is not regionally based- people from all over the country can and do use it.
<li><p>It is the most prestigious variety of English associated with people of high social status.
<li><p>Standard English is the variety of language promoted by educational institutions and is used extensively in government, law and the mass media. It is the form of English that is most widely understood.
<li><p>It is the variety most commonly used in printed texts; but only a minority of people uses it when they speak. Most people use a combination of Standard English and regional features when they speak.
</ol>

<h3><a name="lst"></a></h3>
<p><span>Language standardization</span></p> 
<p>Language standardization is the process by which conventional forms of a language are established and maintained. Standardization may occur as a natural development of a language in a speech community or as an effort by members of a community to impose one dialect or variety as a standard. The term re-standardization refers to the ways in which a language may be reshaped by its speakers and writers.


<p><span>Processes involved in language standardization</span></p> 
<p>Language standardization involves several ways; however, the following are some of the processes/ways involved in language standardization.
	<ul>
<p>i)	Language planning
<p>The term language planning refers to measures taken by official agencies to influence the use of one or more language in a particular speech community. It involves authoritative allocation of resources to the attainment of language status and corpus goals, whether in connection with new functions those are aspired to or in connection with old functions that need to be discharged more adequately. 
<p>Types of language planning
<p>The four major types of language planning are;
<p>a)	Status planning. This is about the social standing of a language. 
<p>b)	Corpus planning. This is about the structure of a language. 
<p>c)	language-in-education planning. This is planning about learning or knowledge acquisition.
<p>d)	Prestige Planning. This planning is about image of a language. 
<p>Language planning may occur at the macro-level (the state) or the micro-level (the community). 
<p>For example, during the standardization of Kiswahili, more efforts were put to influence the use of it by the authorities and the community in general.
<p>ii)	Codification
<p>The linguistic term codification refers to the ways/processes or methods by which a language is standardized. These methods include the creation and use of dictionaries, style and usage guides, traditional grammar text books and the like. Codification is done as a method of spreading the variety/dialect to be standardized. Codification also affects the spoken form of the standard language; for example “Received pronunciation” was codified through the influence of education, particularly that of the 19th century- public schools, followed from the early 20th century by cinema, radio and television (BBC English).

<p>iii)	Linguistic prestige 
<p>This involves attaching social value to a language dialect or variety. The language of powerful social group usually carries linguistic prestige and social prestige is often granted to speakers of prestige languages and varieties. It involves accepting set of social/linguistic norms of a language or dialect chosen. For example, social varieties of American and British English in the world.
<ul><p>iv)	Usage </p></ul>
<p>Usage refers to using specific words in a manner that will be thought of as either acceptable or unacceptable. For example, the question of whether one should use literacy in a non literal sense is one of the usages.
<p>v)	Linguistic ecology 
<p>Linguistic ecology involves the study of languages in relation to one another and to various social factors.  It is also known as language ecology or ecolinguistics. This is meant to know which dialect or language variety will be suitable for use in the society. 
</ul>

<p><span>Lingua- Franca</span></p>
<p>Lingua-franca is a language used as a medium of communication by people whose native languages are different. It is also known as a trade language. For example, English language in Tanzania. Kiswahili is also a lingua Franca; because the languages are used as a common means of communication for speakers of different native languages.
<p><span>Diglossia</span></p>
<p>Diglossia is a situation in which two languages exist side by side and each language is used for different purpose. For example, Kiswahili and English language in Tanzania.
<p>Kiswahili is used as a national language for communication purpose and as a medium of instruction in primary schools. English on the other hand is used as an official language and as a medium of instruction in secondary schools and higher learning instructions. 

<p><span>Bilingualism </span></p>
<p>Bilingualism is the phenomenon or situation of speaking and understanding two languages. The term can refer to individuals (individual bilingualism) as well as to an entire society-social bilingualism.
<p>When a child is born by parents who speak two different languages; similarly, that child will understand both of the two languages belonging to parents. This is the case with bilingualism in the society. For example, in Tanzania, students (children) learn English at their schools on the other side they speak Kiswahili at their homes; hence they become bilingual since they find themselves capable to speak and understand both two language. 
<p>But taking other example in Tanzania, Kiswahili is spoken together with ethic/community languages like Nyakyusa, Hehe, Chagga etc. This also signifies or indicates the so called bilingualism. 
<p><span>Activity 1.4</span></p>
<p>Examine the roles of Kiswahili and English language in Tanzania.

<p><span>Multilingualism</span></p> 
<p>Multilingualism is currently witnessed in most of the communities in the world. People have witnessed their ability of using more than one language; like in Tanzania where Kiswahili, English, French and native languages are spoken by some individuals, this has been for by some individuals, this has been for a reason of accommodating communication needs. 
<p>However, multilingualism is the use of more than one language, either by an individual speaker, or by a community of speakers. Is the situation where by a person speaks many languages.
<p>Multilingualism can be influenced by education, economic, culture, politics, population factors, migration etc. 

<p><span>Reasons for and implications of multilingualism</span></p>
<p>It is said that the only way to fully understand others is to learn their native language, suggesting that translation and interpretation are ultimately doomed to failure. 
<p>Applying this principle for example, to the conflict between the Israel and the Palestinians, one would advise each of the two peoples to learn the other’s language in order to arrive at a mutual understanding.

<p>In order to perceive and understand the other’s real self, one must learn the other’s mother tongues. The film portrays foreign languages as a rescue vehicle that can enable us to escape from intolerant, obscurantist world.
<p>In the social and cultural development of the learner, the target language may have integrative, interpersonal, heuristic and aesthetic functions. It can lead to important metalinguistic, linguistic and normative understanding in the developing linguistic awareness of the learner.
<p>In the affective relationship of the learner to the target culture, the target language can have crucial educational potential.  If properly taught it can smooth the transition from home to school. It can also help to structure the affective world of the learner, and it can be the basic for an education that is linguistically and culturally “decentred” and thus protected against ethnocentrism.
<p>On the side of effects, multilingualism creates classes among the language users due to different perceptions towards what language is better than the other, as from those being taught.
<p>Since students are coming from different linguistic backgrounds, it poses a challenge to the instructor (teacher), since students will be having problems with orthography which entails spelling, pronunciation, grammar etc. 



<p><span>Slangs </span></p> 
<p>Slang is a type of language consisting of words and phrases that are regarded as very informal. Slangs are more common in speeches than in writings and are typically restricted to a particular context or group of people. It is a language of an informal register that members of a special group like teenagers, musicians or criminals favour over a standard language in order to establish group identify, exclude others or outsiders or both. Slangs are marked by non-standard vocabularies.

<p><span>Speech community</span></p> 
<p>Speech community is group of people speaking the same language. People in speech community share a common language or dialect.
<p>A speech community entails a group of people who share a set of linguistic norms and expectations regarding the use of language. It is a concept mostly associated with social linguistics and an anthropological linguistics.
<p>Exactly, how to define speech community is debated in the literature. Definitions of speech community tend to involve varying degrees of emphasis on the following:-
	<ul>
i.	Shared community membership and;
ii.	Shared linguistic communication 
</ul>
<p>A speech community can be a small town, a large/big city. it can also be considered on the single speech community. For example, Tanzania Kiswahili speakers constitute the speech community, since they speak Kiswahili in the way that differentiates them from other East Africa countries. So, a speech community involves the use of language that is differently or unique as from other speech communities. Therefore Tanzania is a speech community.

<p><span>Linguistics</span></p>
<p>Linguistics is the scientific study of language. What this means is that linguistics try to understand the patterns in language by looking at aspects such as the structure of language, language acquisition and learning and relationship between language and culture. In other words, linguistics try to understand how language works, how we use language and what different languages have in common. All topics fall under linguistics. Linguistics is the study of human speech including the units, nature, structure and modification of language.

<p><span>First language/mother tongue</span></p>
<p>First language/mother tongue is a language that a person has been exposed to, from birth or within the critical period. It is used for the language that a person learned as a child at home usually from their parents. It is a language that a person is born with. For example, Makonde, Sukuma, Fipa etc. In Tanzania particular, some individuals acquire Kiswahili as their first language; others acquire it as the second language. Though in most cases, individuals acquire ethnic languages as their first language. it is symbolized as LI

<p><span>Second language- L2</span></p>
<p>Second language (L2) is a language learned by a persona after his /her native language; especially as a resident of an area where it is in general use or any language that a person uses other than a first or native language (L1). In Tanzania, for example, Ethnic languages are the first language while Kiswahili is a second language (L2)

<h3><a name="lle"></a></h3>
<p><span>Language learning/acquisition</span></p> 
<p>Language learning or language acquisition is the process by which humans acquires the capacity (ability) to use language for communication purposes. People always learn the second language (L2) and acquire the first language (L1). In Tanzania for example, English is learned as the second language, Kiswahili is sometimes learned as the second language in schools, this is due to the truth that most students start schools while already having acquired ethic languages at their homes. 
<p>However, in other cases, Kiswahili is a acquired as the first language since some children are born or  exposed to an environments in which Kiswahili is used mostly at home as a means of communication among the parents/family members as a results a child will grow up speaking the same Kiswahili as his / her mother tongue.
<p>English as an international language (EIL)
English is a vibrant and international language with twenty percent of the world’s population speaking English as a native language, second or foreign language, in addition to its status as a mother tongue in many countries, global use of language is growing for communication among speakers of other languages in places where English is not the majority language. in other places English language is used as an alternative language and in other places, English language is used as an alternative language and in other places, English language is used as a national language. It is also used as an official language in many places or countries.
<p>It is obvious true that English is a global language of today; meaning that it is almost used everywhere in the world. However the following are the criteria or factors as to why English is an international language.
<ul> 
<p>a)	Geographical dispersion 
<p>Under geographical dispersion we consider mostly the places; Countries, nations or continents in which English language is spoken or used. English language however is spoken or used in many parts of the world; it is used in America, Britain, Australia, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Nigeria, South Africa etc. In short English language is to day used everywhere in the world; this is what we call geographical dispersion.
<p>b)	Number of speakers
<p>Researches show that English language has high number of speakers. English language likewise is said to have 950 million non-native speakers and 450 million native speakers. This high number of English language speakers comes from different parts of the world. Therefore, the number of speakers making English an international is determined by geographical dispersion, not from within a single region, nation, state or country. Even if the country/nation, may have higher number of native speakers of the language, but will not make such a language international. This is because; it is within a single country. 
<p>c)	The extent to which the language is a medium for science, technology, literature and culture
<p>English language plays a great role in science, technology, literature and culture. It is now days common to find English language in internets; in hospitals for example, instructions on how to use medicine are written in English. Also many literary works or works of arts are written in English. Similarly many books are written in English. English language however is also used in music, entertainments, movies etc. all these criteria make English an international language. 
<p>d)	The economic and political influence of English language speakers
<p>In this aspect, we focus on the influence of English language speakers. English is spoken by worthwhile nations which have influence to other countries all over the world. For example, English is spoken in Britain and America who speak English as native speakers, these economically and politically worthwhile countries have voice over the other nations as a result they spread English language to other countries.

<p><span>The status of English in the world </span></p>
<p><span>English as a native language/first language (ENL)</span></p>
<p>English language is spoken by people who acquire it as their first language or mother tongue. English as a native language (ENL) is commonly distinguished from English as an additional language (EAL), English as a second language (ESL), and English as a foreign language (EFL)
<p>Native English speakers include American English, British English, Australian English, Canadian English, New Zealand English, Irish English, Scottish English and Welsh English. 

<p><span>English as a second language (ESL)</span></p>
<p>English as a second language (ESL) is a traditional term for the use or study of the English language by non native speakers in an English speaking environment. It is also known as English for speakers of other languages, likewise, that environment maybe a country in which English is the mother tongue. For example, Australia, the U.S. or one in which English has an established role like India, Nigeria etc.
<p>English as a second language also refers to specialized approaches to language teaching designed for those whose primary language is not English. 
<p><span>English as a foreign language (EFL)</span></p>
<p>English as a foreign language is the use of English by speakers with different native languages. Language education for people learning English may be known as English as a foreign language; it may also be known as English as a second language (ESL), English as an additional language (EAL), English for speakers of other languages (ESOL). English as a foreign language indicates the teaching of English in a non English speaking region. English as a foreign language is learned either to pass exams as a necessary part of one’s education or for career progression while one works for an organization or business with an international focus. EFL may be part of the state school curriculum in countries where English has no special status. In Tanzania for example, English is a foreign language since it is learned after the native languages have been acquired; and that Tanzania is not a place of origin of the English language. 

<p><span>English as a national language (ENL)</span></p>
<p>English as a national language means that English is used by Governments, churches, mosques, schools and business.  English as “a national language” is also referred to as English as an “Official language”.  Most countries where English is a prominent (Official Language) are former colonies of the British Empire. Notable exceptions include Rwanda which was a former Belgian colony.
<p>English is the sole official / national language of the common wealth of Nations and the common wealth Games. English is one of the national / official languages of the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU) and the international Olympic committee (IOC). Although English is not classified as an official language in the United States, many states and regions within the U.S do have English as an official language. However English is still a national language in USA.

<h3><a name="lpita"></a></h3>
<p><span>Language policy in Tanzania</span></p> 
<p>Many countries have a language policy designed to favour or discharge the use of a particular language or set of languages. Although nations historically have used language policies most often to remote one official language at the expense of others, many countries now have policies designed to protect and promote regional and ethnic languages whose viability is threatened.
<p>Language policy is what a government does either officially through legislation, court decisions or policy to determine how language are used, cultivate language skills needed to meet national priorities or to establish the rights of individuals or groups to use and maintain languages. The scope of language policy varies in practice from state to state. This may be explained by the fact that language policy is often based on contingent historical reasons.
<p>Likewise, states also differ as to the degree of explicitness with which they implement a given language policy .the French law is a good example of explicit language policy. Language policy makes use of technologies influencing speakers of certain language in order to reap economic and or political benefits. Language policy may also simply be defined as an application of power to language. These applications may be language practices, language ideology (beliefs and attitudes), language management, interpreting language hereby widely covering its speakers and the language environment.

<p><span>Goals of language policy</span></p>
<p>Usually the goals of language policy is based on the context/environment in which language is used aiming at social changes, competitiveness etc or the access to power, resources, security, information, entertainment etc. There is neither contact nor conflict between languages, but between speakers and language communities providing infinite sources of conflict.

<p><span>Linguistic situation in Tanzania</span></p>
<p>Tanzania is a multilingual country with 150 ethnic languages spoken within its borders. The current socio-linguistics situation in Tanzania necessitates the continued use of Kiswahili as a unifying language.
<p>The majority of urban children now actually acquire it as their first language. It is also the language most frequently used in government offices as well as in everyday activities country wide. Despite the adoption of one of the Africa’s largest languages as an official language, the government has constantly insisted that English should remain the only medium of instruction at post – primary level, because of its tremendous power and prestige in the global market.
<p>The government’s stance reveals a limited understanding of what a system for promoting bilingualism and biliteracy in education should involve.

<h3><a name="eie"></a></h3>
<p><span>English/Kiswahili in education-schools </span></p>
<p>Nowadays English is used as a medium of instruction in secondary schools and in higher learning institutions like in universities. Again Kiswahili is used as a medium of instruction in primary schools in Tanzania with except English medium schools which also are run in English.
<p>However, most findings reveal that there are standard seven graduates who cannot read and comprehend a story in either Kiswahili or English.  Findings also show that poor English competence, which is common even among university graduates, is a barrier to employment in Tanzania’s high competitive job markets.
<p>This therefore has given fresh momentum to the debate about the language of instruction in Tanzania
<p>In addition, this argument / debate has lead to two groups of people, the first group is those who propose or support that English language be used as a medium of instruction in all levels of education and other issues. The second group is those people who support the status of or use of Kiswahili as a medium of instruction in all levels.
<p>Those who propose the use of Kiswahili as the medium of instruction 
<p>People proposing the use of Kiswahili as the medium of instruction in schools have the following points.
	<ul>
<p>i.	Kiswahili should be used as the medium of instruction because it facilitates communication relatively more easily and connects with our environment, than using English language which is not well understood.  

<p>ii.	The emphasis on Kiswahili as the language of instruction is a wise move highlighting the true spirit of Tanzania. Research and literature have shown that the language of instruction should be what is spoken at home; in our case, Kiswahili. Teaching our children in Kiswahili will improve learning for the masses so let us use Kiswahili as a medium of instruction in schools.

<p>iii.	Tanzania’s school children have demonstrated a good progress in Kiswahili literacy but have low progress in English language. The medium of instruction in our secondary schools. According to Twaweza assessment and other findings, Kiswahili literacy among pupils in standard 3 to 7 is significantly and consistently higher than English so Kiswahili should be used as a medium of instruction in all levels of education.

<p>iv.	Kiswahili should be used as the language of teaching from primary school to university level and English remain as a learning subject. This is because Kiswahili is the home language than English and that using two languages of instruction in schools is confusing children. However, here they insist that Kiswahili should be used as a medium of teaching communication and interaction for international affairs and English language should remain as a subject like other subjects taught in schools. They therefore mention different countries like, China, Russia, Turkey and Germany which use their languages for teaching while regarding others as language for business purposes or international relations. more half century these countries have continued to use their languages and they are making head way economically 

<p>v.	It is better for the government to get away from English language usage from secondary schools to university level and embark on Kiswahili so as to make its head way economically. 

<p>vi.	Teachers themselves, particularly some primary school teachers, especially in public schools lack basic knowledge of their teaching subject, English; because most of them enter the teaching career with poor English foundation hence they should use Kiswahili, the language for which they know better to facilitate better and profound understanding among the students. 

<p>vii.	English is regarded as a colonial language hence teaching or instructing through English is like appreciating for colonialism in the country and that it is like promoting the foreign culture brought about by the colonialists through English language. So Kiswahili should be used as an identity of Tanzania’s culture as from its history.

<p>viii.	It is obvious that Kiswahili will do better than English because it is our second language than English language which needs concerted efforts to improve it.

<p>ix.	However, teachers are using the so called code switching during teaching; this has been observed from many classes, where it has also been discovered that teachers speak Kiswahili to a great extent in their classrooms. Therefore if that is the case, Kiswahili should just be announced direct as a medium of instruction in schools. 
<p>Those who propose the use of English as a medium of instruction in schools
</ul>
<p>People who propose/ support the use of English as the medium of instruction have the following arguments / reasons
	<ul>
<p>i.	English should be used as a medium of instruction in all levels of education because it still largely associated with being learned and because it is much more available in the literary world than Kiswahili.

<p>ii.	English language should be taught as a medium of instruction to make us really capable of using it, and that to pave the room for Tanzanians to be marketable in the current world employments. through English language, Tanzanians will have an access to be employed in other countries else which are English speaking communities and they will work in English industries, commerce, trade, corporations, institutions, transportation, agriculture, services, communication etc. hence English should be taught as a medium of instruction to all levels in Tanzania. 

<p>iii.	From 1990s to date, the teaching of English as a subject in all government schools was declining and that is what motivated the elite to send their children to neighboring countries like Kenya and Uganda to acquire fluent of English so as to meet global demands. So instead of sending our children to neighbouring countries, let us use English as a medium of instruction in all levels of education.

<p>iv.	English is nowadays used everywhere in the world so it should be used as a medium of instruction since it has become the property of every one. It is now considered as not the colonial language as it was thought before due to its long existence in the country. 
<p>v.	English language has long history with Tanzania, so if that is the case it should be formalized as the teaching language to all levels of education in Tanzania.

<!-- <h2>SURA YA TATU</h2> -->

			<h2>WORD FORMATION</h2>
			
	</div>
			
<p>It is obvious true that we use different words in language while speaking, writing and even when we are reading books, texts, stories etc. all these words like wise have undergone the so called word formation. This implies that nothing else new, since all words we speak, read and write, were formed in a certain language else. It is unfortunate that we do not know some of them and the processes they undergone during their formation.
<p>It is therefore, a good chance for us to learn and understand on those words and their formation; this is so because we cannot escape since language is part of us as human beings.
<p>In word formation however, new words are formed or created and becomes useful in our language since, then are used in language to communicate our ideas, feelings and attitudes. This process however entails the so called word formation.
<p>Word formation likewise, refers to the process by which new words are formed or created. In word formation, linguists and people in general come up with new words; meaning that new words are introduced in a language for example, the word bed room has been introduced or formed from combining two words “bed” and “room” through the process known as compounding as it shall be seen later on. Similarly, the word “alcohol” has been introduced from Arabic etc. this is what therefore means with word formation. 

<h3><a name="mrast"></a></h3>
<p><span>Morpheme, root and stem </span></p>
<p>Morpheme entails the smallest grammatical unit in a language which cannot be broken further without losing its meaning. A morpheme is not identical to a word and the principle different between the two is that a morpheme may or may not stand alone where as a word, by definition is a free standing. Examples of morpheme, un-break, able-etc.
<p>When a morpheme stands alone, it is considered a root because it has a meaning of its own for example, the morpheme cat. When it depends on another morpheme to express an idea it is an affix, because it has a grammatical function. 

<p><span>Types of morphemes</span></p>
<p>Morphemes are classified into two types; let us have a look on them
	<ul>
<p>1.	Free morpheme/independent morpheme 
<p>Consider the following examples of words, “manage” as in management, “mother” as in mother hood, “Friend as in friendship. consider other words such as pen, tea, man, cup, etc. all these words seems to stand alone and yet give meaning. This is what we call as “free morpheme”
<p>by its own) without any morpheme necessarily attached to it. It can stand alone as a single or independent word and convey the meaning.

<p>2.	Bound/dependent morpheme
<p>Look on the examples from these words, “ment” as in management, “un” as in unhappy “Fri” as in friend and Friday etc. these words however, lack their free standing meaning, that they need to be attached to other words in order to convey meaning; such words are what implies the what we term as “Bound / dependent morpheme”
<p>Bound/dependent morpheme is thus a type of morpheme which cannot stand alone without being attached to other form of morpheme. It appears in combination with other morpheme, in most cases free morpheme.
</ul>
<p><span>ROOT/ROOT WORD</span></p>
<p>A root (root word) is a word that does not have a prefix at the beginning of the word or a suffix at the end of the word. For example the word “cat”
<p>A root is a primary lexical unit of a word and of a word family. This root is then called the “base word” in short a root is a word which does not receive any kind of affixes i.e prefix, suffix, confix, infix etc.
<p><span>A stem </span></p>
<p>A stem is a part of a word to which affixes are added. It is a form to which affixes can be attached. All derivational affixes are part of the stem. For example; the stem of “friendships” is “friendship” to which the inflectional suffix is – s (which has been attached).
<p>Stems may be a root; for example, “run” or they maybe morphological complex as in compounds words; example, the compound nouns “meatball or bottle opener” or words with derivational morphemes. Example, “back en” or “standard –ize”

	<h3><a name="pofwo"></a></h3>
<p><span>Processes of forming words</span></p>
<p>Different new words are formal from various words forming process. Can you remember what their processes are? Here let us consider the following ways or processes through which new words are formed. Note how they vary from each other.

<p><span>1.	Affixation</span></p> 
<p>Look at the following examples
<ul>
<p>Play 	– 	played
<p>Nation – 	nationalization 
<p>Colonize – 	colonization 
<p>Establish – 	establishment 
<p>Organize –	 organization 
<p>Employed – 	unemployed 
<p>Block – 	blocked 
<p>Fit – 		unfit
<p>Competent – incompetent
</ul>
<p>As you consider the above list of words, you get to know something. What is it? We have then discovered that new words in the list above are created by adding or attaching some letters or particles to the “stems” or existing words. This process of forming new words in such a way is what is called affixation; the words or letters that are attached or added at the roots / stems are called affixes.
<p>Affixation is therefore a process or way of forming a new word by adding affixes or morphemes before or after a word or stem. Thus in affixation prefixes and suffixes are added. 
<p><span>a)	Prefixes</span></p> 
<p>Consider the following list of words
<ul>
<p>Stop – 		nonstop
<p>Committed – 	uncommitted
<p>Comfort – 	uncomfort
<p>Fair – 		unfair
<p>Equal – 	unequal 
<p>Pay – 		re-pay 
<p>Literate – 	illiterate 
<p>Gust – 		dis–gust
<p>Solve – 	unsolve
</ul>
<p>The above list of words shows good examples of words formed by affixation process, however as you attentively look on them, you will discover that, there are words /letters which have been added at the beginning of the roots/stems, such affixes are called prefixes.
<p>Prefixes then are words or letters that are added at the beginning of the root or stem. Prefixes are also classified into different forms/types; let us observe at the following.

	<h3><a name="cpien"></a></h3>
<p><span>Common prefixes in English</span></p> 
English has a number of prefixes forms. Here is a list of the most common prefixes.

<p>1.	Give meaning from each of the following prefixes.</p>
<ul>
<p>i)	trans –
<p>ii)	omni-
<p>iii)	semi-
<p>iv)	sub-

<p>(i)	il-
<p>(j)	non- 
</ul>
<p>b)	Suffixes
<p>Suffixes are affixes as like prefixes. Suffixes are words or letters that are usually attached to the end of a word (root/stem) to form a new word as well as alter the way it functions grammatically. For example, ‘-en,’ as in “block-en”, “-ed” as in “block – ed”, “-ing” as in “cook-ing” etc.
<p>Depending on whether it is a noun, verb, adjective or adverb, a different would be required. For example, the verb “read” can be altered to become the noun reader by adding the suffix-er. The same verb can also be turned into the adjective readable by adding the suffix –able.
<p>It is just as important to understand the definitions of suffixes as prefixes, because they too help us to deduce the meanings of any new words that we learn.
<p>The following are some of the most common suffixes.
<p><span>Noun suffixes </span></p>
<br>
<table>
	<tr><th><span>suffix</th><th><span>meaning</th><th><span>Examples</th></tr>
	<tr><td>ante- </td><td>before </td><td>antenatal, anteroom, antedate.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>-acy</td><td>	state or quality </td><td>	democracy, accuracy, lunacy.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>-al	</td><td>the action or process of </td><td>	remedial, denial, trial, criminal.</td></tr>

</table>
<br>
<p>Noun suffix involves the forming of words (noun) from other categories, verbs, adjectives etc. it involves change into the category of a word from verb to noun, adjective to noun etc. the above words undergoes such changes. Noun suffixes are noun forming suffixes; they form nouns as seen above.</p>
 <p>Verb suffixes</p>
<br>
<table>
	<tr><th><span>suffix</th><th><span>meaning</th><th><span>Examples</th></tr>
	<tr><td>ate- </td><td>become</td><td>mediate, collaborate, create.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>-en	</td><td>become	</td><td>sharpen, strengthen, loosen. </td></tr>
<tr><td>-ify, -fy</td><td>	make or become	</td><td>justify, simplify, magnify, satisfy.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>-ise, -ize</td><td> 	become	</td><td>publicize, synthesize, hypnotize.</td></tr> 

</table>
<br>
<p>As seen from the above words (verb suffixed), the suffixes –ise/-ize, -ify etc. are all used for verifying nouns and adjectives. They are most popular suffixes for verb formation in English particularly common in academic prose. Under verb suffixes adjectives can be changed into verbs.</p>
<br>
<p>Adjective suffices </p>
<table>
	<tr><th><span>suffix</th><th><span>meaning</th><th><span>Examples</th></tr>
	<tr><td>ate- </td><td>become</td><td>mediate, collaborate, create.</td></tr> 
 
<tr><td>-able, -ible</td><td>	capable of being</td><td>	edible, fallible, incredible, audible.</td></tr>  
<tr><td>-al</td><td>	having the form or character of	</td><td>fiscal, thermal, herbal, colonial.</td></tr>  
<tr><td>-esque</td><td>	in a manner or resembling</td><td>	picturesque, burlesque, grotesque.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>-ful</td><td>	notable for</td><td>	handful, playful, hopeful, skilful. </td></tr> 
<tr><td>-ic, -acl</td><td>	having the form or character of</td><td>	psychological, hypocritical, methodical, nonsensical, musical. </td></tr> 
<tr><td>-ions, -ous </td><td>	characterized by</td><td>	pious, jealous, religious, ridiculous.</td></tr>  
<tr><td>-ish</td><td>	having the quality of	</td><td>squeamish, sheepish, childish.</td></tr>  
<tr><td>-ive</td><td>	having the nature of	</td><td>inquisitive, informative, attentive.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>-less</td><td>	without</td><td>	meaningless, hopeless, homeless.</td></tr> 
<tr><td>-y	</td><td>characterized by</td><td>	dainty, beauty, airy, jealous.</td></tr> 
</table>
<br>
<p>Considering the above examples, suffixes are changed into adjectives. Adjective suffixes are therefore the suffixes which produce adjectives after being added/ attached to roots / stems.

	<p>Adverb suffixes</p>

<table>
	<tr><th><span>suffix</th><th><span>meaning</th><th><span>Examples</th></tr>
	<tr><td>-ly	</td><td>Related to or quality </td><td>	Softly, Slowly, Happily, Crazily, Madly.</td></tr> 
	<tr><td>-ward, -wards</td><td>	Direction </td><td>	Towards, Afterwards, Backwards, Inward.</td></tr> 
	<tr><td>-wise</td><td>	In relation to </td><td>	Otherwise, Likewise, Clockwise.</td></tr> 

</table>
<br>
<p>As we see the above example of adverb suffixes, few adverbs are formed from nouns with the suffix -“wise” etc. In short, adverb suffixes are verb forming suffixes. They form verbs. So as you can see, affixes can dramatically change the definitions of words, knowing the various prefixes and suffixes along with their meaning can really help you to understanding how words are used and also how they should be spelt.
<p>Although these groups of letters (affixes) are important and assist with forming words, they are not words in their own right and cannot stand alone in a sentence.


<p><span>2.	 Compounding</span></p> 
<p><span>Look at the following examples</span></p>
<p>Elsewhere, upside, grandmother, cannot, baseball, fireworks, passport, blackbird, blacktop, whitewash, upbringing, firefighter, blacklist, waterline, teenage, brainchild, upwind, rain bow etc.
<p>What do you discover most from the above examples? As we look at words carefully, we find that words are combined together; this is what we call compounding.
<p>Compounding is therefore, a word forming process based on the combination of two lexical items, words or stems. It is the process of forming new words by combining two different words.


<p>i.	Solid compound 
<p>Consider the following examples, backhand, waterfall, supersonic bookmark, format, keyway, lifeguard, forefinger, forefather, honeybee, bookstore, lifeblood, lifeline, forehand, key hole, superstar, bookshelf, backlog, anytime, somehow, supernatural, fortnight, underbelly, supermen, supermarket, somebody, backstage, anymore, bookkeeper, underage etc. 
<p>Hopefully, we have seen different words. How are they? How do these words look like? Probably you can guess something else behind those words in combination; they are combined into two, but written as a single word. This is what entails with “solid compound”
<p>Solid compound is thus a word formed from the combination of two or more other words written as one segment.
<p>ii.	Open compound 
<p>Look at the following examples
<p>Backside, under cut, super strong, air field, sidekick, back breaker, back drop, back fire, textbook, keypad, up stairs, soft ball, super cool, key stone, key stroke, super hero, one self, fore see, fore man, carpool, up wind, upgrade, up board, dish water, dish pan, boldface, up right etc.
<p>We have seen different words. What have you noticed? How is that words are separate? From the examples, we discover that two different words are written as separate words. This is what is known as “open compounds”
<p>Open compound is then a word formed from the combination of two or more different words written or spelled as a separate words (or written as two words)
<p>iii.	Hyphenated compound
<p>Consider the number of examples below
<p>Care-taker, car-sick, car-fare, car-go, up-take, carry-all, cart-wheels, wash-cloth, fish-like, water-proof, fish-net, in-take, court-yard, over-flow, under-cover, over-coat, take-teller, take-over, super-human, waste-land, set-back, after-life, main-land, cave-man, air-time, all-over, note-book, fire-proof, throw-away, moon-beam, sun-day etc.
<p>We have all observed the examples from different words as above. What is so unique? Do you think words are combined? Do words appear as a segment? Words are separated by a hyphen (-), yet they stand as one segment. This is what we call hyphenated compound. 
<p>Hyphenated compounds likewise, are words formed from the combination of two or more words joined by a hyphen (-)
<p><span>3.	Acronyms </span></p>
<p>Observe at the following examples.
<p>WB – From World Bank
<p>IMF – from international Monetary Fund
<p>ATM – From Automatic Machine 
<p>TWA - from Tanzania Women Association 
<p>RC – Regional Commissioner
<p>TCU – Tanzania Commission for Universities
<p>Regarding on the example above, can you guess something? Can you discover the meaning of acronyms? Probably, one would say, are words created from the initials? For some instances, acronyms are created or formed from letters found within a particular word. For example, central Bank (as in CB), and bank of Tanzania (as in BOT). This is what means with acronyms.
<p>Acronyms therefore are words formed as an abbreviation from the initial components in a phrase or a word. It is a process of forming new words by taking initial letters (abbreviations) from the whole word as seen in above examples
<p><span>4.	Back Formation </span></p>
<ul>
<p>Look at the following examples 
<p>- Ablute from ablution 
<p>- Accrete from accretion 
<p>- Admix from admixture
<p>- Acculturate from acculturation 
<p>- Adolescence from adolescence
<p>- Adulate from adulation  
<p>- Attrit from attrition 
<p>- Automate from automation 
<p>- Aviate from aviation 
<p>- Back from back-formation
</ul> 
<p>As we see from the above examples, new words are formed from the existing words. How is formation done? As we look carefully we may discover or note that words are created or formed by removal of a suffix. Such a process is what entails “backformation”
<p>Back formation mean while, is a process of forming a new word from an existing word, typically by removal of suffix they definition evident as you consider the examples above. 
<p><span>5.	Coining/Invention/Neologism </span></p>
<p>It is the process of word formation where by the new words are introduced or invented in the language; this is always from the existing materials to represent new invention or development etc. words like computer, nylon, Yahoo, Google, tweet Cred, spam, App, BFF, aspirin, Hoover, band-aid, Kleenex, Xerox, escalator, Tipex, zipper, granola, circumvent etc. Have you come across any great neologism? Consider carefully the examples above and have suggested your own neologism.

<p><span>6.	Clipping </span></p>
<p>Consider the following words
 
 
<p>A
	<ul>
<p>Math (as from mathematics)
<p>Memo (as from memorandum)

<p>Mod (as from modern)
<p>Photo (as from photography)
<p>Pop (as from popular)
<p>Pro (as from professional)
<p>Prof (as from professor)
<p>Prom (as from promenade)
<p>Ref (as from referee)
</ul>
<p>B
	<ul>
<p>Mend (as from amend)
<p>Phone (as from telephone)
<p>Pike (as from turnpike)
<p>Plane (as from air plane)
<p>Quake (as from earthquake)
<p>Sport (as from disport) 
<p>still (as from distill)
<p>Tails (as from coattails)
</ul>
 <p>C 
 	<ul>
<p>Fridge (as from refrigerator)
<p>Flue (as from influenza)
</ul>
 
<p>From the examples A, B and C above what is so special with clipping?
<p>Again as we look at examples we notice that some words are being reduced from one of its parts. How is then reduction done? It is obviously seen that, reduction of these words from one of its parts; is mostly seen or done at the beginning or at the end of words. Can you give us your own examples of words formed through clipping? Think as many examples as possible to increase your language power. All these examples however encompass the so called clipping.
<p>Clipping is therefore a word forming process which involves reduction of a word to one of its parts, the  reduction of a word part occurs either at the beginning or at the end of the word/stem or both at the beginning and at the end of words as demonstrated in the above examples.
<p><span>7.	Blending </span></p>
<p>This is the word forming process in which a new word is formed by joining parts of two words after clipping. Consider the following examples.
	<ul>
<p>- Smog (from smoke and fog) 
<p>- Internet (from international and network)
<p>- Spanglish (from Spanish and English)
<p>- Spork (from spoon and fork)
<p>- Frenemy (from friend and enemy)
<p>- Emoticon (from emotion and icon)
<p>- Blog (from web and log)
<p>- Brunch (from breakfast and lunch)
<p>- Cyborg (from cybernetic and organism) 
<p>- Motel (from motor and hotel)
</ul>

<p>(b) How is clipping different from blending.

<p><span>8.	Redublication </span></p>
<p>This is the process of word formation in which new words are formed by repeating all or part of the word.  It involves almost the same sounds or words. It however involves copying a part or portion of a word to form a new word. Redublication might attempt you to think and believe as if it is like compounds. However, it differs from compounding since it involves almost similar or the same sounds. 

<p>Study the examples below

 <ul>
<p>Please – please
<p>Come –come
<p>Stop – stop
<p>Again – again
<p>Very – very 
<p>Good – good
<p>Pee – pee
<p>Boo – boo
<p>Cray – Cray
<p>Bye – bye
<p>Chop – chop
<p>Goody – goody 
<p>Knock – knock 
<p>Night – night
<p>Rah – rah
<p>Tom – tom 
<p>Boy – boy 
 </ul>
<p>The above words entail what we call redublication.  In redublication slangs also are involved. It however, appears most commonly in pidgins intentionally to serve some crucial purposes as imitation of sounds, suggesting movements, a state of disorder and to add intensification. 

<p><span>9. Conversion/ Zero Derivation</span></p> 
<p>This is the process of word formation involving the creation of a word (of a new word class) from an existing word, of a different word class without any change in the form of a word which is to say, derivation using only zero. Observe at the following examples.
<ul>	
<p>a)	
	<ul><p>i) They sent me an email</p></ul>
<ul><p>ii) They mailed a letter</p></ul> 
<p>b)	
	<ul><p>i) They saw a clean boy </p></ul>
 	<ul><p>ii) They cleaned the room</p></ul> 

<p>c)</p>	
	<ul><p>i) The conduct was poor</p></ul> 
	<ul><p>ii) They conducted a meeting</p></ul> 

<p>d)	
		<ul><p>i) The imports were poor</p></ul>
		<ul><p>ii) They imported maize</p></ul> 

<p>e)	
	<ul><p>i) The electrical was broken </p></ul>
	<ul><p>ii) They wired a house</p></ul>
</ul> 
<p>From the above examples, the underlined words change their classes to new words class. As observed, one word seems to assume different functions as it changes its class. Again we discover that the same word functions as a noun and on the other hand functions as a verb, leading to formation of new words. 
<p><span>Activity 2.2</span></p>
1.	Mention 10 words that can be formed from conversion 

<p><span>10. Borrowing</span></p> 
<p>It happens that words from one language are used in another language else, that is to say words from either French language can be used in English language and like. For example, the word “Alcohol” is from Arabic language; this is what entails the so termed borrowing.
 <p>Study the examples below:-
 <ul>
<p>Court (from French)
<p>Zero (from Arabic)
<p>Skipper (from Dutch)
<p>War (from old French)
<p>Person (from Latin)
<p>Law (French)
<p>Culture (French)
<p>Physician (from Latin)
<p>Catastrophe (from Greek)
<p>Mosquito (from Spanish)
<p>Marijuana (from Spanish)
<p>Umbrella (from Spanish)
<p>Art, food, drink (from Dutch)
<p>Kindergarten (from German)
<p>Bagel (from Yiddish)
<p>Icon (from Russia)
<p>Jungle (from Hindi)
<p>Banana (from Portuguese)
<p>Safari (from Kiswahili) 
 </ul>
 
<p>The above are different words from different languages. This serves as word formation in language; however it implies what is known as “Borrowing.”
<p>Borrowing is likewise the process of forming new words by which a word from one language is adapted for use in another language. The word that is borrowed is called a borrowing, a barrowed word or a loan word.

			<h2>LISTENING SKILLS</h2>
			
	</div>
			
<p>Listening is so important that many top employers provide listening skills training for their employees; this is not surprising when you consider that good listening skills can lead to better customer satisfaction, greater productivity with fewer mistakes and increased sharing of information that in turn can lead to more creative and innovative work.

<h3><a name="wilsfa"></a></h3>	
<p><span>What is listening so far?</span></p>
<p>Listening is the ability to accurately receive and interpret massages in the communication process.  Listening is a key to all effective communications. Without the ability to listen effectively, messages are easily misunderstood. As a result communication breaks down and the sender of the message can easily become frustrated or irritated. 
<p>Many successful leaders and entrepreneurs credit their success to effective listening skills. It is one of the main factors behind the success.

	<h3><a name="wieli"></a></h3>
<p><span>What is effective listening?</span></p>
<p>Effective listening is a skill that underpins all positive human relationships. We should therefore spend some time thinking about and developing our listening skills – they are the building blocks of success.
<p>Good listening skills also have benefits in our personal lives including a greater number of friends and social networks, improved self-esteem and confidence, higher grades at school and in academic work and even better health and general well-being.
<p>Studies have shown that where as speaking raises blood pressure, attentive listening can bring it down

	<h3><a name="lahe"></a></h3>
<p><span>Listening and hearing</span></p>
<p>Listening is not the same as hearing; hearing refers to the sounds that enter your ears. It is a physical process that provided you do not have any hearing problems, happens automatically.
<p>Listening however requires more than that, it requires focus and concentrated effort, both mental and sometimes physical as well. 
<p>Listening means paying attention not only to the story but how it is told, the use of language and voice and how the other person uses his or her body. In other words, it means being aware of both verbal and non verbal messages. Your ability to listen effectively depends on the degree to which you perceive and understand these messages. 
<p>Listening is not passive process; infact, the listener can and should be at least as engaged in the process as the speaker. The phrase “active listening” is used to describe this process of being fully involved. Effective listening requires concentration and the use of your other senses not just hearing the words spoken.
<p>Listening is not the same as hearing and in order to listen effectively you need to use more than just your ears.

We give speeches and make presentation with the assumption that people will listen to us. It is therefore essential that a speaker understands what listening involves. The speaker can legitimately expect that an audience will hear the words spoken, but hearing does not necessarily constitute effective listening. An audience is not actually listening unless the speech (presentation) is attentive enough to comprehend fully the meaning of the speaker’s words. In achieving this, there are some strategies. However, the following are; 

<h3><a name="lstsale"></a></h3>
listening strategies to speeches and lectures.
<p><span>1.	Face the speaker and maintain eye contact.</span></p> 
<p>In most cases eye contact is considered a basic ingredient of effective communication. When we talk, we look each other in the eye. that does not mean that you can’t carry on a conversation from across the room or from another room, but if the conversation continues for any length of time you (or the other person) will get up and move the desire for better communication pulls you together. In short you should look positively.
<p><span>2.	Be attentive but relaxed</span></p> 
<p>Now that you have made eye contact, relax. You do not have to stare fixedly at the other person. You can look away now and then and carry on like a normal person. The important thing is to be attentive. To “attend” another person means to be present, give attention, apply or direct yourself, pay attention, and remain ready to serve.
<p>Mentally screen out distractions, like background activity and noise. In addition, try not to focus on the speaker’s accent or speech mannerisms to the point where they become distractions.
Finally, don’t be distracted by your own thoughts, feelings or biases.
<p><span>3. Keep an open mind</span></p>
<p>Listen without judging the other person or mentally criticizing the things he/ she tells you. If what he/she says alarms you, go ahead and feel alarmed, but do not say to yourself. As soon as you indulge in judgmental bemusement, you have compromised your effectiveness as a listener.
<p>Listen without jumping to conclusion, remember that the speaker is using language to present the thoughts and feelings inside his/her brain. You do not know what these thoughts and feelings are and the only way you will find out is by listening.
<p>Again, don’t be a sentence-grabber since grabbing of sentences hinder effective communication.
<p><span>4. Listen to the words </span></p>
<p>You should listen to the words and try to picture what the speaker is saying. Allow your mind to create a mental model of the information being communicated. Whether a literal picture, or an arrangement of abstract concepts, your brain will do the necessary work if you stay focused; with senses fully alert. When listening for long stretches, concentrate on, and remember key words and phrases.
<p>When it is your turn to listen, don’t spend the time planning what to say next. You cannot rehearse and listen at the same time. Think only about what the other person is saying.
<p>Finally concentrate on what is being said, even if it bores you. If your thoughts start to wander, immediately force yourself to refocus. 
<p><span>5. Don’t interrupt </span></p>
<p>Do not interrupt and do not impose your “solutions”. Interrupting sends a variety of messages. It says:-
	<ul>
<p>(a)	“I’m more important than you are”
<p>(b)	“What I have to say is more interesting, accurate or relevant”
<p>(c)	“I do not really care what you think”
<p>(d)	“I do not have time for your opinion”
<p>(e)	“ This is not a conversation, it is a contest, I’m going to win”
</ul>   
<p>We all think and speak at different rates. If you are a quick thinker and an agile talker, the burden is on you to relax your pace for the slower, more thoughtful communicator- or for the guy who has trouble expressing him/her. 
<p>When listening to someone talk about a problem, refrain from suggesting solutions. Most of us do not want your advice anyway. If we do, well ask for it. Most of us prefer to figure out our own solutions. We need you to listen and help us do that, somewhere down the line, if you are absolutely bursting with a brilliant solution, at least get the speaker’s permission. Ask, would you like to hear my ideas?
<p><span>6. Wait for the speaker to pause to ask clarifying questions
<p>When you do not understand something of course you should ask the speaker to explain it to you; but rather than interrupt. Wait until the speaker pauses, then say something like, back up a second. I didn’t understand what you just said about …. 
<p><span>7. Ask questions </span></p>
<p>In listening you should ask questions only to ensure understanding. Our questions lead people in directions that have nothing to do with where they thought they were going. Sometimes we work our way back to the original topic, but very often we do not. 
<p>When you notice that your questions has led the speaker astray, take responsibility for getting the conversation back on track by saying something like “It was great to hear about…..
Questions however, attract attention, questions shows that you are together with the speaker and you care much for what he/she says. 


<p><span>8. Try to feel what the speaker is feeling
<p>You should feel sad when the person with whom you are talking expresses sadness, joyful when he/she expresses joy, fearful when she/he describes her/his fears and convey those feelings through your facial expressions and words-then your effectiveness as a listener is assured. Empathy is the heart and soul of good listening.
<p>To experience empathy, you have to put yourself in the other persons place and allow yourself to feel what it is like to be her at that moment. This is not an easy thing to do. It takes energy and concentration. But it is a generous and helpful thing to do and it facilitates communication like nothing else does.
<p><span>9. Give the speaker regular feedback</span></p>
<p>Show that you understand where the speaker is coming form by reflecting the speaker’s feelings. “You must be thrilled!” what a terrible or deal for you”. I can see that you are confused. “If the speaker’s feelings are hidden or unclear, then occasionally paraphrase the content of the message or just nod and show your understanding through appropriate facial expressions and an occasional well-timed “Hmmm” or Uhhuh”. The idea is to give the speaker some proof that you are listening and that you are following his/her training of thoughts not off indulging in your own fantasies while he/she talks to the ether. 
<p>In task situations, regardless of whether at work or home, always restate instructions and messages to be sure you understand correctly.
<p><span>10. Pay attention to what is not said (non-verbal cues).</span></p>
<p>Face to face with a person, you can detect enthusiasm, boredom or irritation very quickly in the expression around the eyes, the set of the mouth, the slope of the shoulders, these are clues you cannot ignore. When listening, remember that words convey only a fraction of the message.

<p><span>Note taking in Listening</span></p>
<p>Taking effective notes in lectures and tutorials is an essentials skill for academic study, especially in university study, colleges and in schools. Good note taking allows a permanent record of key information that you can integrate with your own writing and use for exam revisions. Taking reliable, accurate notes also reduces the risk of plagiarising. It helps you distinguish where your ideas came from and how and what you think about those ideas.
<p>Why note taking? 
<p>There are many reasons for taking notes. However, the following are some of the reasons as to why we take notes.
	<ul>
<p>i)	Notes are useful record of key information and the source of that information.
<p>ii)	Notes inscribe information kinesthetically and help you remember what you heard.
<p>iii)	Taking notes helps you to concentrate and listen effectively
<p>iv)	Selecting what to note down increases your understanding. 
<p>v)	Notes taken in classes often contain information that cannot be found elsewhere.
<p>vi)	Notes create a resource for exam preparation.
</ul> 
<p>Note taking is the practice of recording information captured from another. But in taking notes, the writer records the essence of the information, freeing their mind from having to recall everything. Notes are commonly drawn from a transient source such as an oral discussion, at a meeting or a lecture. Notes of a meeting are usually called minutes in which case the notes may be the only record of the event. Note taking is a form of self discipline.
<p>Things to consider when taking notes
<p>1)	Go to class prepared (get prepared) 
<p>Always have a plan and believe in it. Nothing good happens by accident. You should get prepared yourself, mentally, psychologically as well as materially. Read the assigned materials and previous class notes before the class. Have your own notebook, pen etc. for note taking you will have a better understanding about what the instructor is lecturing about and that will allow you to better decipher the more important point of the lecture.
<p>2)	Improve your listening skills 
Learn how to listen and you will prosper even from those who talk badly. Here consider the following points.
<ul>
<p>a)	Start by entering the classroom with a positive attitude
<p>b)	Make a conscious effort to pay attention. Concentrate on concentration, without concentration there is no focus and without focus there is no learning.
<p>c)	Adapt to whatever direction a lecture takes, when a lecture takes an unexpected detour, say a student asks a question you are not particularly interested in; students have a tendency to “zone out” before you know it. Again let say the lecture got back on track five minutes ago and you missed crucial information that should have been noted. Still adapt to this.
</ul>
<p>3)	Develop a note taking method
<p>You should develop a note taking method that works for you; tune the structure and organization of your notes to increase your note taking speed and comprehension later. Consider the points below.
	<ul>
<p>(a)	Start each new lecture on a new page and date and number each page. The sequence of the material is important.
<p>(b)	Write on one side of the paper only. you can set them outside-by-side for easier reviewing when studying for an exam.
<p>(c)	Leave blank spaces, this allows you to add comments or note questions later.
<p>(d)	Make your notes as brief as possible. never use a sentence when you can use a word. This means do not write each and everything. 
<p>(e)	Develop a system of abbreviations and symbols you can use wherever possible.
<p>(f)	Note all unfamiliar vocabularies or concepts you do not understand. This reminds you to look them up later.
</ul>
<p>4)	Pay close attention to content 
<p>There is a great difference between knowing a thing and understanding it. Knowing what and how much to write down is difficult. rely on some of the following tips for what to include in your notes.
	<ul>
<p>(a)	Details, facts, Or explanations that expands or explains the main points that are mentioned. Do not forget examples.
<p>(b)	Definitions, word for word.
<p>(c)	Enumerations or lists of things that are discussed.
<p>(d)	Material written on the chalkboard or on a transparency including drawings or charts.
<p>(e)	Information that is repeated or spelled out.
</ul>
<p>5)	Review and edit your notes
<p>Academic skills centres and other authorities on effective study skills consider reviewing and editing class notes to be the most important part of note taking and essential to increasing learning capacity. While reviewing class notes, one should practice the following.
	<ul>
<p>a)	Edit for words and phrases that are illegible or do not make sense. Write out abbreviated words that might be unclear later.
<p>b)	Edit with a different coloured pen to distinguish between what you wrote in class and what you filled in later.
<p>c)	Fill in key words and questions in the left hand column.
<p>d)	Note anything you do not understanding by underlining or highlighting to remind you to ask the instructor.
<p>e)	Compare your notes with the textbook reading and fill in important details in the blank spaces you left.
<p>f)	Consider rewriting or typing up your notes.
</ul>

<p><span>Distinguishing between facts and opinions.</span></p>
 <p>Facts and opinions are often uttered in the same breath, the terms have a huge difference in their meanings whether a statement is a fact or an opinion depends on the validity of the statement. While a fact refers to the something true or real which is backed by evidence, documentation, etc. on the other hand opinion is what a person believes or thinks about something. 
<p>In fine terms, a fact is a proven truth, where as opinion is a personal view, that represents the outlook of an individual which may or may not be based on the fact. In this manner an attempt is made to show you the differences between fact and opinion. Consider the following points.
<ul> 
<p>1.	Fact is described as the statement that can be verified or proved to be true. Opinion is an expression of judgment or belief about something.
<p>2.	Facts are based on observation or research while opinions are based on assumptions or personal views.
<p>3.	Facts are objective reality whereas opinion is a subjective statement.
<p>4.	Facts can be verified with the help of evidence or statistics. On the contrary opinion is not supported by any evidence.
<p>5.	Facts represents something really happened unlike an opinion that represents a perception about something.
<p>6.	Facts are universal while opinions differs from person to person 
<p>7.	Facts are shown with unbiased words. However, opinions are expressed with biased words.
<p>8.	Facts are not debated since they are real information while opinions are debated. 
<p>9.	Facts have the power to influence others while opinions do not have the power to influence others.
</ul> 
<p>When one for example says Tanzania got independence in 1961, this is with no doubt a fact but when one says Tanzania got independence in 1964, this is again with no doubt an opinion. So facts as does with truth while an opinion is personal view based. 
<p>Therefore to know the reliability and utility of an information or statement, it is vital to understand the differences between facts and opinions so as to evaluate things and draw conclusions. While reading comprehensions, it is hard to identify whether a given expression is a fact or an opinion as they are quite commonly juxtaposed by the writers. Facts are always one step ahead of opinions as facts can be proved to be right or accurate where as opinions may also be right but they cannot be proved as true


<p><span>Activity 3.1 </span></p>
<p>Say whether the sentence below is a fact or an opinion?
<p>i)	I think your room is the messiest, I have ever seen 
<p>A.	Fact B. Opinion 

<p>ii)	The hardest thing to learn in school is science
<p>A.	Fact B. Opinion 

<p>iii)	Which of the following sentences is an opinion?
<p>A.	John Marshal was the most intelligent chief justice in the united state.
<p>B.	In 1819, the Supreme Court ruled that congress could create a national bank.
<p>C.	Marshall also ruled that the states did not have the right to tax the bank or any other agency created by the federal government.
<p>D.	The chief justice is part of the judicial branch of government

<p>iv)	Read the passage below to answer questions that follow. 
<p>The best amendment that was passed by congress was the 19th amendment. It states that, the rights of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex. Think that all women should be proud and vote in every election. It was not so long ago that wicked men prevented the most intelligent sex in America from voting.
<p>a)	Which sentences from the above passage are facts?
<p>b)	Identify all words which are opinions
<p>c)	Identify all words which are not opinions.

<p>Recognizing idiomatic expressions 
<p>It is important to learn and use idioms and expressions in context. of course, idioms are not always easy to understand. There are idioms and expression resources that can help with definitions, but reading them in short stories can also provide context that make them come more alive. Try reading the story one time to understand the gist without using the idiom definitions. On your second reading, use the definitions to help you understand the text while learning new idioms.
<p>After you understand the story, take the quiz at the end of each reading to test your knowledge.

	<h3><a name="liico"></a></h3>
<p>Learning idioms in context
<p>You might wonder how you can recognize an idiom when you are reading a book, online or perhaps watching TV. Here are a few tips on how you can spot an idiom.
<p>a)	Idioms do not mean what they say that is right, the actual meaning of the words do not necessarily indicate the meaning of the idiom. let us take a look at a few.
<p>-	Remember my son; the early bird catches the worm.
<p>This idiom means that it is important to get up and get to work in order to succeed in life; of course, early birds probably catch worms as well! However, the meaning has nothing little to do with the birds.
<p>b)	Idioms can seem out of context 
<p>You can be sure you have spotted an idiom if you notice that the words have little to do with the context. For example, let us imagine that you are in a business meeting. someone says,
<p>-	Well, it will be smooth sailing after quarter
<p>If you are in a business meeting, you do not expect to be talking about sailing on the open sea; this is an example of something out of context. It does not fit in that is a sure sign that it might be an idiom.
<p>c)	Idioms are often phrasal verbs 
<p>Phrasal verbs can be literal of figurative. Literal means that the words mean exactly what they say. For example,
<p>-	I picked up the bag
<p>In this case “Pick up” is literal. Phrasal verbs can also be figurative “Pickup” also means to learn.
<p>-	She picked up some Spanish in Madrid

<p>d)	Idioms are often figurative phrasal verbs as well 
<p>Again, consider the following idioms in context, expressions and their meaning.
	<ul>
<p>1.	All that glitters is not gold (Not everything that looks good is Gold). 
<p>2.	Cross a bridge when one comes to it. Deal with a situation when it happens, used when explaining that one should not worry too much about possible problems. 
<p>3.	Fall into the trap, do something that something wants you to do in order to take advantage of you.
<p>4.	Feel put-upon: feel like someone forcing you to do something you do not want to do.
<p>5.	Get something under one’s belt: experience something.
<p>6.	Get the short end of the stick, lose in an arrangement of some sort; receive the smallest portion.
<p>7.	Have the heart skip a beat: be surprised by something 
<p>8.	Hit a happy medium: find balance between extremes 
<p>9.	Kid around: have a fun, joke
<p>10.	Presence of mind: the ability you calmly think about a situation and make the best decision rather than act on emotion. 
<p>11.	Push some one’s buttons: know exactly what to say to anger another person.
<p>12.	Put something into practice: do something that you want to become a habit often used when following advice.
<p>13.	Regain one’s composure: find balance after having becoming very emotional (anger, sadness, spite etc.)
<p>14.	Run like water off a duck’s buck: not bother or affect someone 
<p>15.	Straighten something out: resolve a problem
<p>16.	Throw someone a curve ball: do something that surprises someone, often used when negative events happen.
<p>17.	Turn on a dime: change without hesitation.
<p>18.	Chip on your shoulder: being upset for something that happened in the past 
<p>19.	Blessing in disquise: something good that is not recognized at first
<p>20.	Drop in the bucked: a very small part of something big or whole.
<p>21.	Leopard can’t change his spots: you cannot change who you are 
<p>22.	A penny saved is a penny earned: by not spending money, you are saving money (little by little).
<p>23.	A picture paints a thousand words: a visual presentation is far more descriptive than words.
<p>24.	A piece of cake: a task that can be accomplished very easily 
<p>25.	A slap on the wrist: a very mild punishment
<p>26.	A taste of your own medicine: when you are mistreated the same way you mistreat others. 
<p>27.	A Toss – up: A result that is still unclear and can go either way.
<p>28.	An action speaks louder than words: it is better to actually do something than just talking about it.
<p>29.	Add fuel to the fire: whenever something is done to make a bad situation even worse than it is.
<p>30.	Against the clock: rushed and short on time.

<p><span>Collocations</span></p>
<p>Becoming aware of collocations is part of vocabulary learning, all language have a large number of collocating words. A good dictionary will help you and dictionaries of collocations are also available.
<p>In linguistics, a collocation is a sequence of words or terms that co-occur more often than would be expected by chance. 
<p>In English however, a collocation is two or more words that go together naturally. Learning collocations is essential for making your English sound fluent and natural for example big, great, large, deep, strong and heavy. 
<p>Collocations may be strong or weak. Strong collocations are where the link between the two words is quite fixed and restricted. Weak collocations are where a word can collocate with many other words. 
<p>Consider the following examples of weak collocations.
	<ul>
<p>- Big/enormous/large +house/lorry/cup 
<p>- Fast/shiny/expensive + car/motorbike/aeroplane.
<p>- Very/really/extremely+interesting/hot/generous
<p>- Brown/straight/long +fence/hair/line.
</ul>
<p>Similarly consider other examples of strong collocations. 
<ul>
<p>Handsome – boy 
<p>Beautiful – girl 
<p>Whisk an egg – curly hair 
<p>Winding road – blissfully ignorant
</ul>
<p>Collocations likewise are in most cases determined by the society and not linguistically determined. 
<p>Again as from examples above, collocations are partly or fully fixed expressions that become establishes through repeated context–dependent use. such terms as crystal clear; middle management, “nuclear family” and cosmetic surgery are examples of collocated pairs of words.
<p>Collocation can be in a syntactic relation such as verb-object “make” and “decision”, lexical relation such as antonym or they can be in no linguistically defined relation. 
<p>Knowledge of collocations as stated is vital for the competent use of a language. A grammatically correct sentence will stand out as awkward if collocational preferences are violated, this makes collocation an interesting area for language teaching and learning.

<p><span>Activity 3.2</span></p> 
<p>Select the correct words from the following words to make correct collocations. Note list A collocates with list B

<p><span>Register differences</span></p> 
<p>In linguistics, a register is a variety of a language used for a particular purpose or in a particular social setting. For example, when speaking in a formal setting, an English speaker may be more likely to use features of prescribed grammar than in an informal setting; such as pronouncing words ending – ing with a velar nasal instead of an alveolar nasal. For example, “walking” not “walkin,” Choosing more formal words like father Vs dad, child Vs kid etc. and refraining from using words considered non standard such as “ain’t”.
<p>Register is a variety of language determined according to language use. Consider language of lawyers, teachers, medical doctors, psychologists, physicians, nurses etc. you may learn something different especially when using language. Likewise, register can be determined by a jargon.
<p><span>“Jargon, register” and “style” </span></p>
<p>Jargon is the vocabulary of a particular group or subculture as computer geeks, engineers, judges etc. it is the in-group vocabulary of a technological or social group. It works like slang to mark belonging; slang may in fact be considered a kind of jargon. 
<p>Register again is the speech and writing of a social class, more or less, when speaking with my peers. I’m likely to use a register that when speaking with strangers or a formal setting.
<p>Style is a matter of artistry with words. How one arranges semantics, thoughts, figures of speech, rhythm and sound in writing or speaking are matters of style. Style can also determine register. Drug users have therefore their own style of speaking a language and hence have their own registers.
<p>There is a clear difference in register between formal and informal style of using a language, therefore, it is important to understand the differences in the language used between these two styles or registers.
<p>The following provides comparative examples of the two registers
	<ul>
<p>1. 	Formal language makes use of complex sentence structure. For example; 
<p>i)	In 2001, the bridge was built. This was politically, two countries united = informal.
<p>ii)	The bridge was completed in 2001 which resulted in a positive political move that united two countries = formal.
</ul>
<ul>
<p>2.	Formal language is objective. For example;
<p>i)	I think/ believe that the issue of global warming will be the primary concern at the meeting = informal 
<p>ii)	There is little doubt/ it is clear that the issue of global warming will be the primary concern at the meeting = formal. 
</ul>
<ul>
<p>3.	Formal language does not use colloquialism, language which is common to spoken English. For example; 
<p>i)	Sweden’s prime minister Fredrick Redt, totally flipped out when he read the latest report from the press= informal
<p>ii)	The prime minister of Sweden, Fredrick Redt, expressed his concern when he viewed the most recent report from the press = formal.
</ul>
<ul>
<p>4.	Formal language focuses more on vocabulary choice. For example;
<p>i)	The research assistant checked out the incident and got back to  him the next day = informal 
<p>ii)	The research assistant investigated the incident and reported to him the following day = formal.
</ul>
<ul>
<p>5.	Formal language makes use of the discipline specific vocabulary. For example;
<p>i)	Germs grow well in dirty and warm temperatures = informal.
<p>ii)	Bacteria thrive in unhygienic and warm conditions = formal.
</ul>
<ul>
<p><p>6.	Formal language does not use contractions. For example;
<p>i)	When considering staffing in hospitals in the future. It is difficult not be concerned = informal 
<p>ii)	When considering staffing in hospitals in the future, it is difficult not to be concerned = formal.
 </ul>

<p><span>Activity 3.3</span></p> 
<p>1.	Identify and explain register differences.

<h3><a name="tco"></a></h3>
<p><span>Telephone communication </span></p> 
<p>A telephone or phone is a telecommunications device that permits two or more users to conduct a conversation when they are too far apart to be heard directly. A telephone converts sound, typically and most efficiently the human voice, into electronic signals that are transmitted via cables and other communication channels to another telephone which reproduces the sound to the receiving user.
<p>A telephone network enables instant voice communication between two people. All countries have a telephone network but the proportion of people who have access to a telephone varies from country to country. In the UK, over 95% of people have a telephone at time.
<p>People who use a telephone system are known as subscribers. Each telephone connected to a network is identified by a unique number. To start a conversation with another person, on the network you must dial the number of the person’s telephone. A modern telephone system relies on a lot of highly sophisticated computer equipment to manage and connect calls. 
<p>Subscribers have to pay to use the telephone network. This payment consists of a fixed monthly charge for connection to the network and call charges, the cost of a call depends upon the length of the call, the time of day at which it is made and the distance between the people making and receiving the call.
<p>The telephone network can also be used for transmitting data with a modern or for sending faxes. In the UK, more than half of the capacity of the telephone network is now used for sending data. 
<p><span>Advantages of telephone communication</span></p>
<p>1.	You can communicate instantly with another person, anywhere in the word.
<p>2.	A telephone conversation is interactive. You can listen to what the other person has to say and react to it straight away.
<p>However, there are some disadvantages of telephone communication, these disadvantages includes the following.
<p>1.	Some people do not have access to a telephone; this is particularly the case in poorer countries.
<p>2.	You can send information with a telephone. You cannot send package.
<p>3.	There is no permanent record of what you have said or heard on the telephone, unless it is recorded.
<p>Consider the following example, and then make practice with your fellow students

<p>Hamisi		: Hello Musa
<p>Musa		: hello 
<p>Hamisi		: Have you heard the news? 
<p>Musa		: No I haven’t 
<p>Hamisi		: It is about death 
<p>Musa		: Who has died?
<p>Hamisi		: Our believed friend Alex
<p>Musa		: Oh!! My God! what has he died from?
<p>Hamisi	: HIV/AIDs. It is said he was a HIV/AIDs victim  longtime ago.
<p>Musa		: May the lord rest his soul in eternal peace 
<p>Hamis		: Amen, see you later 
<p>Musa		: Thanks. Have the good day 

	<p><span>Activity 3.4 </span></p>
<p>1.	What is the message contained in Hamis’ call?
<p>2.	Why do speakers use kind language? 


<p><span>Taking telephone message</span></p> 
<p>Telephone message refer to a message transmitted by telephone. Likewise, phone message refer to communication usually brief that is written or spoken or signaled.
<p>In this age of cell phones, telephone etiquette has largely gone by the wayside. Knowing how to take messages is still useful when you are working in an office or taking calls for someone else; Being polite, writing everything down and delivering the message promptly. 
<br>
<img src="{%static 'accounts/img/phonenglish.jpg'%}" class="img-responsive" alt=""'>
 <br>
<p>While taking telephone message for other person else, there are important informations to be considered. Look at the following example
<ul> 
<p>i.	Message taken for ……………………..
<p>ii.	Message taken from ……………………
<p>iii.	Tel. No…………………………………..
<p>iv.	Date of the message ……………………
<p>v.	Time of the message ……………………
<p>vi.	Taker’s of the message………………….

						<h2>SPEAKING SKILLS</h2>

									
									
							</div>

<p>Speaking allows you to actually broaden your world from job opportunities to the ability to relate to people from every country. Knowing the language makes it much more interesting in the current world.
<p>Speaking however is something that we always perform. As we are human beings, we then use language to communicate. In using language, Language skills are involved. Likewise, speaking is one of the language skills through which people use mostly.
<p>Speaking is inclusive, since all people can speak; the only thing that differentiates people in speaking, is speaking skills. Since speaking is more than just talking, rather speaking is a skill (way or technique).
<p>Speaking therefore is the action of conveying information or expressing one’s feelings in speech. it is an interactive process of constructing meaning that involves producing information. Its form and meaning are dependent on the context in which it occurs; including the participants themselves, their collective experiences, the physical environment and the purpose for speaking. It is often spontaneous, open-ended and evolving. 
 <p>Speech is however not always predictable. The Language functions (patterns) that tend to recur in certain discourse situations; for example, declining an invitation or requesting time off from work; can be identified and chartered. For instance, when a sales person asks “may I help you”? The expected discourse sequence includes a statement of need, response to the need, offer of appreciation, acknowledgement of exchange etc. Speaking requires that learners not only know how to produce specific points of language such as grammar, pronunciation or vocabulary (linguistic competence), but also that they understand when, why and in what ways to produce language (sociolinguistic competence). Finally speech has its own skills, structures and conventions different from written language. A good speakers synthesizes this array of skills and knowledge to succeed in a given speech act.

 	<h3><a name="wagsdo"></a></h3>
<p><span>What a good speaker does?</span></p>
<p>A speaker’s skills and speech habits have an impact on the success of any exchange. Speakers must be able to anticipate and then produce the expected patterns of specific discourse situations; they must also manage discrete elements such as turn-taking, rephrasing, providing feedback or redirection. For example, a learner involved in the exchange with the sales person described previously must know the usual patterns that such an interaction follows and access that knowledge as the exchange progresses.
<p>The learner must also choose the correct vocabulary to describe the item sought, rephrase or emphasize words to clarify the description, if the person does not understand and use appropriate facial expressions to indicate satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the service. Other skills and knowledge that instruction might address include the following:
	<ul>
<p>a)	Producing the sound, stress, patterns, rhythmic structures and intonations of the language 
<p>b)	Using grammar structures accurately.
<p>c)	Assessing characteristics of the target audience, including shared knowledge or shared points of references, status and power relations of participants, interest levels or differences in perspectives.
<p>d)	Selecting vocabulary that is understandable and appropriate for the audience, the topic being discussed and the setting in which the speech act occurs.
<p>e)	Applying strategies to enhance comprehensibility such as rephrasing key words, rephrasing or checking for listener comprehension etc.
<p>f)	Using gestures or body language and paying attention to the success of the interaction and adjusting components of speech such as vocabulary, rate of speech and complexity of grammar structures to maximize listener’s comprehension and involvement.
</ul>
<p>Teachers should monitor learners’ speech production to determine what skills and knowledge they already have and what area need development.
<p>The question on what a good speaker does entails the skills of speaking. So that question has been answered regarding all the speaking skills.


<h3><a name="hslffwla"></a></h3>
<p><span>How spoken Language differ from written language?</span></p>
<p>There are many differences between the processes of speaking and writing. Writing is not simply speech written down on paper; learning to write is not a natural extension of learning to speak. Unlike speech, writing requires systematic instruction and practice. Here are some of the differences between speaking and writing that may clarify things for you and help you in your effort as a writer and speaker.
<table>
<tr><th><span>Speech </span></th><th><span>Writing </span></th></tr>


<tr><td>i)	Universal, everybody acquires it </td><td>i)	Not everyone learns to read and write</td></tr> 

<tr><td>ii)	Spoken language has dialect variations that represent a region </td><td>ii)	Written language is more restricted and generally follows a standardized form of grammar, structure, organization and vocabulary.</td></tr>

<tr><td>iii) Speakers use their voices (pitch, rhythm, stress) and their bodies to communicate their message </td><td> iii)	Writers rely on the words on the page to express meaning and their ideas</td></tr>


<tr><td>iv)	Speakers use pauses and into nation </td><td>iv)	Writers use punctuation</td></tr>

<tr><td>v)	Speakers pronounce </td><td>v)	Writers spell </td></tr>

<tr><td>vi)	Speaking is often spontaneous and unplanned  </td><td>vi)	Most writing is planned and can be changed through editing and revision before an audience reads it.</td></tr>

<tr><td>vii)	Speakers have immediate audiences who nod, interrupt, question and comment </td><td>vii)	Writers have a delayed response from audiences or none at all and have only one opportunity to convey their message, be interesting, informative, and accurate and hold their readers attention.</td></tr>

<tr><td>viii)	Speech is usually informal and repetitive </td><td>viii)	Writing on the other hand is more formal and compact. It progresses more logically with fewer explanations and digression. </td></tr>

<tr><td>ix)	Speakers use simple sentences connected by lots of ands and buts</td><td> ix)	Writer’s use more complex sentences with connecting words like however, who, although and addition. </td></tr>

<tr><td>x)	Speakers draw on their listeners reactions to know how or whether to continue </td><td>x)	Writers are often solitary in their process.</td></tr>

<tr><td>xi)	Speakers can gauge the attitudes, beliefs and feelings of their audience by their verbal and non-verbal reaction</td><td> xi)	Writers must consider what and how much their audience needs to know about a given topic.</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>Both spoken and written language is linked to social background, age, race and gender of the writer, speaker and audience. Depending upon whom we are addressing and what we are discussing, we can switch between formal and informal ways of communicating.

	<h3><a name="pr"></a></h3>
<p><span>Pronunciation</span></p>
<p>A word can be spoken in different ways by various individuals or groups depending on many factors, such as duration of the cultural exposure of their childhood, the location of their current residence, speech or voice disorders, their ethnic groups, their social class, or their education.
<p>Pronunciation is however the way in which a word or a language is spoken. This may refer to generally agreed-upon sequences of sounds used in speaking a given word or language in a specific dialect (correct pronunciation) or simply the way a particular individual speaks a word or language.
<p>In pronunciation, letters are used as symbols to represent sounds.  Consider the following alphabetic symbols. 
<p>/f/, /V/, /k/, /g/, /t/, /d/ etc. but other symbols are not alphabetical letters for instance /ǽ/, /ə/, /ǳ/, /θ/etc.

	<h3><a name="ph"></a></h3>
<p><span>Phonemes </span></p>
<p>A phoneme is one of the units of sound or gesture in the case of sign languages that distinguish differ in meaning  through a contrast of a single phonemes form what is called a minimal one word from another in a particular language. For example, in most dialect of English, the sounds patterns /θm/ (thumb) and /d/dumb/ are two separate words distinguished by the substitution of one phonemes /θ/, for another phoneme, /d/. two words like this and that differ in meaning through a contrast of a single phoneme form called a minimal pair. In many other languages these would be interpreted as exactly the same set of phonemes. i.e. /θ/ and /d/ would be considered the same.
<p>In language, phonemes usually are established by the use of minimal pairs, such as kill and kiss; pat and bat are written between slashes. For example, /p/ to show pronunciation. There are two kinds of English phonemes, vowels and consonants. 

	<h3><a name="ssien"></a></h3>
<p><span>Speech Sound in English</span></p> 
<p>English, like any other language, has a number of speech sounds which functions as basic building blocks of the spoken language. In standard British English, there are 44 such speech sounds, divided into different categories. The most basic categories being VOWELS and CONSONANTS.
<p>These speech sounds are called PHONEMES. A phoneme as above may also be defined as the smallest language unit that is able to distinguish meaning. A minimal pair as above is a pair of words that differ in one sound only. For example, pan and ban, illustrates this quite clearly. By replacing with, the meaning of the word in the two sounds in this case is very similar
<p>Phonemes are abstract units that may come out in different forms. For instance, if you experiment by pronouncing the word KEY and CAR and isolate “the” in both words, you will hear that the two sounds are quite different from each other.
<p>As mentioned above, there are two types of English phoneme vowels and consonants.
<p>Let us have a look on them.

	<h3><a name="vo"></a></h3>
<p><span>Vowels</span></p> 
<p>A Vowel is one of the two principle classes of speech sounds, the other being consonant. Vowels vary in quality, in loudness and also in quantity (length). They are usually voiced and are closely involved in prosodic variation such as tone, intonation and stress. 
<p>Vowel sounds are produced with an open vocal tract. In English the word vowel is commonly used to refer both to vowel sounds and to the written symbols that represent them. 
<p><span>Types of Vowels</span></p> 
<p>English vowels are classified into three main types, namely as monophthongs, diphthongs and triphthongs. Let us have a look on them.
<p>i)	Monophthongs
<p>These are vowels that have a single perceived auditory quality. As the prefix “mono” suggests, a monophthong. It is a single vowel sound within a syllable. Most of these are short vowels; though there are some long vowel monophthongs as well. However, most of the monophthongs in English are commonly known as “short vowels” which are usually produced when a vowel is followed by one or more consonants in a syllable
<p>Monophthongs are also called pure vowel sounds and they are 12 in number.
	<ul>
<p>1 	/i/ as in see, unique, feel 
<p>2	 /ɪ/ as in wit, mystic, little 
<p>3. 	/e/ as in set, meant, bet
<p>4	/a/  as in pat, cash, bad
<p>5	/a/ as in half, part, father 
<p>6	/ɔː/ as in port, caught, all.
<p>7	/ɒ / as in not, what, cost.
<p>8	/ʊ/ as in wood, could, put
<p>9	/ʊ/ as in you, music, rude.
<p>10	/˄/ as in bus, come, but 
<p>11	/3:/ as in beard, word, for 
<p>12	/ә/ as in alone, butter, ago.
</ul>
<p>As seen, the above are 12 vowel sounds according to RP-English.
<p><span>Activity 4.1</span></p>
<p>Study the following words below and say how they can be pronounced.
<p>Slip, boat, pop, me, need, be, bit, with, put, would, look, new, you, who woman, port, caught, pat, cash, wit, feel, ago, see, pen, come, mar, room, cat, hit, good, cut, tough, cool.
<p>However, pronunciation is physical and as we go through these sounds you need to think about these three questions; is your mouth open, closed or in the middle? What is the position of your tongue? What shape are your lips?
<p>Likewise, for the vowel sounds on the top now the mount is almost closed. Sounds like /i/, /ɪ/, / uː/
<p>On the other hand, for the vowel sounds on the bottom row, the mouth is almost wide open, sounds such as /æ /, /a:/, /ɔ:/, /˄/,/e/, /3:/ for the sounds on the left, our tongue is near the front teeth; sounds are such as /i:/, /e/ and /æ /.
<p>In addition when we get to the right, it has moved back a little bit. For example /u:/ /ɔ:/  and /3:/
<p>Let us look more at some example words for each sound.
<p>/i/ as in “me”, “these”, “need” and “be” 
<p>/ ɪ / as in “with, “this”, “if” and “think”
<p>  /ʊ/ as in ‘put’, ‘would’, ‘look’ and ‘woman’
<p>/uː/ as in ‘to’ ‘you’, ‘new’ and ‘who’.
<p>Do you see how the position of letters related to the where the sounds come from?
<p>On the second row the mouth is open a little more. Again the tongue should move back a little as we go through them from left to right. Consider the following sounds.
<p>/e/ as in ‘get’ ‘when’, ‘well’ and ‘very’ 
<p>/ә/ as in ‘the’, ‘about’, ‘could, and ‘us’ 
<p>/ ɔ:/ as in ‘her’, ‘work, ‘learn’ and ‘word’ 
<p> /ɔ:/ s in ‘or,’ also, ‘more’ and ‘call’.
<p>Now let us look at the bottom row where our mouth should be almost wide open. Consider the sounds below. 
<p>/æ / as in “have”, “that”, “as” and “can” 
<p>/˄/ as in “but”, “up”, “one” and “much”
<p>/ɑː/ as in “start”, “ask”, “large” and “after”
<p>/ ɒ / as in “of” “on” front” and “not”
<p>So the above are all single vowels. Obviously there are a lot of examples but the examples given above are some of the most common words, the important thing to remember is pronunciation is physical.
<p><span>Diphthongs </span></p>
<p>These are sounds formed by the combination of two vowels in a single syllable, in which the sound begins as one vowel and moves towards another; as in coin, loud and side. They are also known as glinding vowels. They are combination of two adjacent vowel sounds within the same syllable.

<p>Let us look at these sounds. 
<p>/eɪ/	as in play, way, lay, may, pain, cocain, plain, date, height, aid, aim, fail mail, sail, tail, snail, claim, main, pain, chain, stain,, strain, wait, gait, paints, faint, waist.
<p>/aɪ/ 	as in flight, bright, mine sky, fly, mind, HI, shy, write, bye, buy, high, light my, nice, style, site, raise, rise, digraph, digest.
<p>/aʊ/	as in loud, brown, round, house, trauma, Baum, haut, cow, plough, about, drought, fraud, doubt, count, bounce.
<p>/ɔɪ/ 	as in boy, toy, boil, toil, oil, foil, soil, spoil, coin, join, choice, voice, noise, joy, oyster, enjoy, employ, annoy, destroy, decoy, Roy, Floyd, voyage, loyal, soybeans etc.
<p>/əʊ/	as in go, brow, hoe, draw, bow, door, sow, know, home, ago, alone etc.
<p>/ɪə/ 	as in clear, near, career, tear, liar, gear, bear, ear, tear.
<p>/ʊə/ 	as in endure, sure, pure, assure, cure, lure etc.
<p>/eə/	as in wear, share, air, hair, care, pair, dare wear.

<p><span>Activity 4.2 </span></p>
<p>Look at the following words and say how they are pronounced.
<p>Plain, date, shy, why, buy, high, raise, drought, cow, joint, voice, boy, alone, home, bear, gear, clear, pure, cure, bare, fare, air.
<p>As we have pronounced the above sounds. Now let us read aloud the following pronunciation and pay attention to each word pronounced.
<p>/peɪ/,  /eɪd/,  /eɪm/,  /kleɪm/,  /weɪ/,  /maɪ/,  /baɪ/,  /naɪs/,  /haɪ/,  /ʃaɪ/, /əˈbaʊt/,  /ˈtraʊmə/,  /fraʊdɪ/,  /kaʊ/, /dʒɔɪnt/,  /bɔɪ/, /kɔɪn/,  /dɪˈkɔɪ/,  /ɡəʊ/,  /əˈləʊn/,  /həʊm/, /əˈɡəʊ/,  /pjʊə/, /pʊə/,  /lʊə/,  /əˈʃʊə/,  /peə/,  /weə/,  /keə/,  /deə/,  /beə/.

<p><span>Triphthongs </span></p>
<p>These refer to the union of three vowels (letters or sounds) pronounced in one syllable, as in fire, beau etc. from tri-means three.
<p>Consider the following examples.
<p>/eɪə/  as in player, layer, mayer, payer etc. 
<p>/aɪə/ as in tire, fire, dire, inspire, Ireland, pyre  etc.
<p>/ɔɪə/ as in soya, employer, royal etc.
<p>/aʊə/ as in flour, sour etc.
<p>/aʊə/ as in our, lower, hour, mower, tower.
<p>A triphthong is a long sound which is comprised of three combined vowel sounds in a single syllable.  Some speakers break triphthongs into two syllables, a dipththong and a schwa.

<p><span>Activity 4.4.</span></p>
<p>Look at the following words and practice on how they are to be pronounced.
i)	Mayer 		ii) lawyer 	iii) hire 	iv) spire 
v)   layer 	            vi) sour 	vii) blour 	viii) royal 
ix)  our 		x) mour 

<p><span>Consonants </span></p>  
<p>These are speech sounds that are articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. Examples are /P/, pronounced with the lips; /t/, pronounced with the front of the tongue; /k/, pronounced with the back of the tongue, /h/ pronounced in the throat, /f/ and /s/ pronounced by forcing the air through a narrow channel (fricatives). /m/ and /n/ which have air flowing through the nose (nasals).
<p>Since the number of possible sounds in all of the world’s language is much greater than the number of letters in any one alphabet, linguists have devised systems such as the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPAA) to assign a unique and unambiguous symbol to each attested consonant. 
<p>In fact the English alphabet has fewer consonant letters than English has consonants sound, so diagraphs like “ch” “sh” “th” and Zh” are used to extend the alphabet and some letters and diagraphs represents more than one consonant. For example, the sound spelled “th” in “this” is a different consonant than the “th” sound in “thin”. In the IPA they are transcribed /ð/ and /θ/ respectively. However, ‘ch”  “sh” and “zh” in IPA style are transcribed as /tʃ/, /ʃ/ and /dʒ/.

<p>Look at the following 24 consonant sounds.
<p>/t/	 as in tail, time, team, tea, tenor, hit, tell, task, students, boat, rest, tone, tune.
<p>/P/ 	as in pair, cup, pop, pump, people, play, party, paper, person, pick, pour, public, apple.
<p>/b/	 as in bad, crab, bull, ban, beef, baby, best, buy, bring, blind, about, absent.
<p>/d/ 	as in dark, head, day, dear, die, door, duty, admire, hidden, kind, ride, ended. 
<p>/k/	 as in cake, come, clean, cry, scratch, act, panic, clear, keep, kind, kill, kilogram.
<p>/g/	 as in game, gap, get, go, gun, great, global, giggle, ago, begin, dog, eggs, general.
<p>/h/	as in hair, help, history, home, hotel, hunt, behind, inherit, hour, honor, honest,
<p>/j/ 	as in jam, Jane, jet, jelly, Jim, Jingle, joke, June, just, Yes, your. Again as in general, giant, agent, suggest, Egypt.
<p>/l/ 	as in late, let, live, alone, close, slim, please, old, nicely, table, file, all. 
<p>/m/	 as in make, men, mind, mother, must, my, common, summer, name, form, team.
<p>/n/      as in napkin, never, night, no, nuclear, funny, students, kindness, ton, sun.
<p>/r/	as in rain, red, rise, brief, grow, scream, truck, arrive, hurry, turn, more, car.
<p>/s/	 as in send, simple, song, system, street, lost, kiss, release. Again as in center, cellar.
<p>/z/	as in zero, zoo, horizon, puzzle, crazy, organize, cause, always, is, was, reason.
<p>/v/	as in vast, vein, vivid, voice, even. Review, invest, give, move, active.
<p>/w/	as in wall, war, west, wind, word, would, swear, swim, twenty, twist.
<p>/s/	as in shirt, show, share, she, shine, shoes, fish, cash, push, finish.
<p>/ð/	as in this, that, then, though, father, brother, breathe, bathe.
<p>/θ/ 	as in thank, thick, think, thought, thunder, author, breathe, bath.
<p>/ŋ/	as in king, sing, singer, singing, bang, long, wrong, tongue.
<p>/tʃ/	as in chain, check, chief, choose, teacher, much, church, kitchen, catch, match, watch etc.
<p>/dʒ/	 as in bridge, edge, judge, badger, knowledge, budget.
<p>/ʒ/	as in pleasure, measure, vision, fusion, Asia, visual, treasure etc.
<p>The most important thing to note is that some consonant sounds have more than one spelling. In addition, some letters represents many sounds (i.e. more than one sound). For example, the letter “C” represents the consonants sounds /s/ and /k/ as in words “centre” and “cellar” and as in “cake” and “come”. Letter “g” also consists of consonant sounds /g/, /j/ and /ʒ/ as in ago, general, and energy. Letter “X” also represents sound /k/, /s/, /g/ and /z/ as in relax, exam, and xenophobia. Letter “Z” similarly represents sound /z/ itself as in zero, zoo and as in pizza, Mozart, waltz etc.  
<p>Another important thing to note is that letter “Y” can function as a vowel or as a consonant. As a vowel “Y” has the vowel sound /i/, and /ai/; as a consonant “Y” has the consonant sound /Y/ i.e. a semi- vowel sound, usually at the beginning of the word and only in the syllable before a vowel. Consider at the examples below.
<p>/i:/ baby, hurry, lyrics, mystery.
<p>/ai/ by, try, rely, nylon, type.
<p>/Y/ yard, year, yes, yet, yield, you, young etc.
<p>Again, letter “W” represents the vowel sound /u:/ as in the diphthongs /aʊ/ and /əʊ/  for example, now, how, owl, brown, low, own, bowl. 
<p><span>Activity 4.5</span></p>

<p><span>Syllable</span> </p>



<p>In actual language use, people put together (combines) vowel phonemes to form units of sound. These units are then referred to as syllables. 
<p>A syllable is however a unit of pronunciation having one vowel sound with or without surrounding consonants, forming the whole or a part of a word. For example, there are two syllables in “water” and three in “inferno.” the two syllables in water are ( wa and ter).  The three syllables in inferno are (In-fer-no). A syllable is typically made up of a syllable nucleus (most often a vowel) with optional initial and final margins (typically consonants).
<p>Syllables are often considered the phonological “building blocks” of words. They influence the rhythm of a language, its prosody, its poetic meter and its stress patterns. 
<p><span>Types of syllables in English</span></p>
<p>English syllables are categorized into four (4) types; Basing on their number of syllables. These include the following.
<p>i)	Monosyllable/monosyllabic. It is a word that consists of a single syllable; for example, dog, add, beg, bell, arm, air etc.

<p>ii)	Disyllable/bisyllabic. It is a word that consists of two syllables. For example, acid, actor, advise, adult, accuse etc.

<p>iii)	 trisyllable/trisyllabic. It is a word consisting of three syllables. For example, amendment, animal, appendix, attendance, applicant, approval etc. 

<p>iv)	 Polysyllable/polysyllabic. This may refer either to a word of more than three syllables or to any word of more than one syllable i.e. words with many syllables. For example, availability, imagination, accommodation, capability, identification etc. 
<p>Look at the following examples of words that contain one (1) syllable.
<p>Act, add, age, arch, arm, art, aunt, back, bad, bald, ball, ban, band, bang, bank, bar, bare, base, bath, bay, be, beech, beam, bean, bear, beat, bed, beer
<p>Again, consider the following words that contain two syllables.
<p>absence, abuse, accent, access, account, accuse, achieve, acid, acquire, acre, action, actor, acute, adapt, address, adjust.
<p> admire, admit, adopt, adult, advance, advice.
<p>Observe at the following words that contains three syllables.
<p>Abandon, abolish, absolute, acceptance, accident, accountant, achievement, acknowledge, activate, addition, admission, adjustment, advantage, adventure, advertise, adviser, advocate, afternoon, agency, agenda, agreement, alcohol, alliance, allocate, allowance etc.
<p>You can also consider the following words which have more than three syllables (have many syllables).
<p>Availability, identification, responsibility, accommodation, administration, anniversary, association, capability, characteristics, classification, communication, consideration, constituency, determination, differentiate, disability, discrimination, electricity etc.
<p>It is important for students to recognise syllables in words. When they are able to say one syllable at a time, spelling becomes much easier. Fortunately recognizing syllables is an easy concept to teach. Consider the following transcribed words and practice them on yourself.
<p>i)/tɔɪ/   ii) /hɔ:t/  iii)  /eɪd/         iv)/sevən/     v) /dɔ:g/      vi)/trʌk/    vii)/əˈɡriːmənt/   viii) /bɔːl/   ix)/əveɪləˈbɪlɪti/     x)/transˈleɪt/     xi)/ædɪ/   xii) /ˈpaʊə/   xiii) /transˈleɪʃ(ə)n/  xiv) /ləŋgwɪdʒ/    xv) /ˈneɪtʃə/    xvi)/ˈstɑːfrʊm/    xvii)/ˈtiːtʃə/   xviii) /ˈɪŋɡlɪʃ/     xix)/pəˈfɔːm(ə)ns/    xx)/ˈkɒmpɪt(ə)ns/  xxi /ˈɡræmə/
<p>As we have seen from the sounds above one can identify the number of syllables just by pronouncing the unit of sounds i.e. by transcribing the syllable words.

<p><span>Activity 4.8</span></p> 
</p> 1.	Identify the number of syllables from the following words 
</p> Job, huge, judge, kick, know, dock, dress, egg, feel, firm, villa, widow, woman, ugly, tutor, update, unit, unkind, TV, traffic, undergo, tribunal, turnover, telephone, surgery, survival, studio, substitute, satisfy, subsidiary, university, probability, personality, imagination, laboratory, responsibility, classification.
</p> After we have identified the number of syllables above. It seems that he unit of pronunciation consisting one vowel sound, with or without consonant sound, is then counted as a syllable.
</p> <span>Activity 4.9 </span></p>
</p> Look at the following words and try to pronounce each of them 
</p> Angry, appeal, arty, assign, attain, banking, beauty, bible, army, asset, assume, author, award, billion, begin, bishop, body, clarify, collector, company, consider, consumer, continue, corridor, qualification, opportunity.
</p> Functional characteristics of the syllable.
</p> The syllable as a phonological unit performs three functions constitutive, distinctive and identification function; they are closely connected.


<p>1.	Constitutive function</p>
</p> Syllables constitute words, phrases and sentences through the combination of their prosodic features, loudness, stress, pitch, tone, duration, length and tempo. Syllables may be stressed, unstressed, high, mid, low, rising, falling long or short. all these prosodic features-constitute the stress pattern of words, tonal and rhythmic structure of an utterance, helps to perform distinctive variations on the syllabic level. 
</p>2.	Distinctive function</p>
</p> If we compare the words “lightening and lightning” we may observe that their syllabicity is the only minimal, distinctive feature. There are rather many combinations in English distinguished from each by means of the difference in the place of syllabic boundary. The distinctive function of the syllabic boundary makes it possible to introduce the term “juncture.” Close juncture or conjucture occurs between sounds within one syllable for example, in the name I scream, the close juncture is between /s/ and /k/. open juncture, disjuncture or internal open juncture occurs between two syllables.
</p> 3.	Identification function
</p> This function is conditioned by the pronunciation of the speaker; the listener can understand the exact meaning of the utterance only if he perceives the correct syllabic boundary i.e. “syllabic juncture”. For example, peastalks- peace talks, mytrain- might rain. The existence of such pairs demands special attention to teaching not only the correct pronunciation of sounds, but also the observation of the correct place for syllabic juncture. 


<h3><a name="rodwtiasy"></a></h3>
</p> <span>Rules of dividing word to identify a syllable</span></p>
</p> There are six (6) rules that help us in identifying a syllable; however, these rules do with dividing a word in writing. look at the following rules.
</p> (i)	Never divide a word within a syllable
</p> (ii)	Never divide an ending (a suffix) of two syllables such as -ble, -ably-fuly.
</p> (iii)	With the exception of –ly, never divide a word so that an end-ing of two letters such as-ed, -er, -ic, begins the next line.
</p> (iv)	Never divide a word so that one of the parts is a single letter.
</p> (v)	Never divide a word of one syllable.
</p> (vi)	Never divide a word of less than five letters.
</p> Syllables can be stressed or unstressed; before discussing, let us look first on the so called stress.

<h3><a name="wsiela"></a></h3>
</p> <span>Word stress in English language</span></p> 
</p> To communicate clearly when you are speaking in English; it is important to stress the correct syllables in each word. This is called word stress which means pronouncing one syllable of a multisyllabic word with greater emphasis (stress). Word stress refers to the emphasis given to a particular syllable or word in speech, typically through a combination of relatively greater loudness, higher pitch and longer duration. Normally the stress falls in the first syllable. The emphasis (stress) is given on an important point, statement or idea.
</p> Consider the following examples
<ul> 
</p> a)	`I want it done very, very neatly
</p> b)	`I avoid many of the things that used to stress me before.
</p> c)	`HIV/AIDS is still a threat to the current world.
</p> d)	The `examination will tell whether he was studying or not.
</p> e)	The `Judge has sentences the `thief
</ul>
</p> Stress is an extra force or importance attached or put to a word in order to show emphasis. for example, when we say “matata will come”. In this sentence; the stress has been attached to a noun “matata” and to a verb “come”. This emphasizes on someone called matata and that will come here. Therefore the importance is on matata and his comings.
</p> <span>Activity 4.10</span></p> 
</p> Place stress on the following words 
</p> (i)	Nation 	(ii) import 	(iii) Disobey 	(iv) Door (v) Flexibility 	 (vi) Examination	(vii) classification (viii) Red board    (ix) Glue 	   (x) expresident    (xi) Abnormal (xii) complication (xiii) discrimination 	(xiv) Colonization (xv) formation   (xvi) juncture     (xvii) pen 	    (xviii) bell (xix) application 	(xx) adventure.

</p> <span>Types of English word stress</span></p>
</p> English word stresses are classified into two types namely primary and secondary stress. 
</p> 1.	Primary word stress 
</p> Primary stress is the heaviest stress or force given to one syllable IN a spoken word or to one word in an utterance, the strongest of the four phonemic degrees of stress. It  is the strongest emphasis in a word of two or more syllables when you say the word “fantastic” the primary stress is on the middle syllable “tas”. Primary stress again refers to the strongest degree of stress places on a syllable in the pronunciation of a word. The mark (Ꞌ) is used to indicate the strongest degree of stress. 
</p> As said above; primary stress is marked in IPA by putting a raised vertical line (Ꞌ) at the begging of the syllable. Consider the examples below.
</p> Ꞌimport, Ꞌconduct, Ꞌbank, Ꞌbook, Ꞌaccent, Ꞌblack, Ꞌblond, Ꞌexport, Ꞌpresent, Ꞌpen, Ꞌaccuse, Ꞌadvance, Ꞌamend,   Ꞌappendix,  Ꞌ approval
</p> 2.	Secondary word stress 
</p> These are syllables which are not completely stressed, yet are not as loud as primary stress. Secondary stress is marked with a lower vertical line (,) at the beginning of the syllable. Unstressed syllables are syllables that have no stress at all. In English, almost all of these have schwa /ə/sound for their vowel. For example, the, go, grow, blow, through etc.
</p> Rules for Placing Stress in Words
</p> In order to master effective pronunciation of words, some rules for placing stress in words need to be observed. on contrary, there are many rules of placing stress in words. However the following are the most important rules for placing stress in words.
</p> 1.	Stress the first syllable of
</p> i)	Most two-syllable nouns. Examples, CLImate, KNOWledge
</p> ii)	Most two-syllable adjectives. Examples, FLIPpaints, SPACious.
</p> 2.	Stress the last syllable of;
</p> i)	Most two-syllable verbs, examples, reQUIRE, deCIDE.
</p> 3.	Stress the second-to- last syllable of;
</p> i)	Words that end in –ic examples, ecstatic, geoGRAPHIC 
</p> ii)	Words ending in –sion and –tion; examples,  exTENsion, retriBUtion 
</p> 4.	Stress the third -from-last syllable of; 
</p> i)	Words that end in –cy-ty-phy and –gy. Examples, deMOCracy, unCERtainty, geOGraphy, radiOLogy. 
</p> ii)	Words that end in-al; examples, exCEPtional, CRItical. 
</p> 5.	Only vowel sounds are stressed (a, e, i, o, u). Keep these simple rules in mind and you will soon find your pronunciation getting better and better.
</p> The syllable of greatest prominence is known as the primary stressed syllable or the syllable that carries primary stress.

</p> The primary stressed syllable can be marked by placing a diacritic in the following way
<ul> 
</p> A Ꞌpart 
</p> De Ꞌfine
</p> ꞋPattern 
</p> ꞋMetal 
</p> ꞋImpudent 
</p> ꞋMiserable
</p> ꞋPhonetics
</ul>
</p>  
However compound words which have two separate words have two stresses; one of them primary and the other secondary. The secondary stress can precede or follow the primary stress and there need not be an intervening syllable.

</p> Look at the following examples.
<ul>

</p>ꞋSur charge. 
</p>Ꞌblack board
</p>Ꞌsuper glasses 
</p>Ꞌsun glasses
</p>Ꞌloud speakers
</p>Ꞌup stairs or up Ꞌstairs
</p>Out Ꞌstare
</ul>

<h3><a name="usy"></a></h3>
</p><span>Unstressed syllable</span></ul> 
</p>In most cases syllables other than primary stressed, secondary stressed or unreduced syllables are unstressed. Generally in English, the large majority of the vowels of unstressed syllables can be transcribed as schwa. Consider the examples below.

 <br><br>

<table>

<tr><td> Abduct </td><td>/əbˈdʌkt/ </td></tr> 
<tr><td> Admit </td><td>/ədˈmɪt/ </td></tr> 
<tr><td>Combine  </td><td>/kəmˈbæɪn/ </td></tr> 
<tr><td> Confirmation </td><td>	/kɒnfəˈmeɪʃ(ə)n/ </td></tr> 
<tr><td> Condition </td><td>/kənˈdɪʃ(ə)n/	 </td></tr> 
<tr><td> Abortion </td><td>	/əˈbɔːʃ(ə)n/ </td></tr> 
</table>
<br>
</p>There are also some cases where by unstressed vowels have a quality other than a schwa sound. It is not possible to list them all, but some of these include words that end in unstressed –ish, -ic, -ism and –ing.
</p>Observe at the following example.
<br>
<table>
<tr><td>/ˈrædɪʃ/ </td><td>Radish</td></tr>
<tr><td>/ˈmjuːzɪk/</td><td> Music</td></tr>

<tr><td>/ˈkɒmjʊnɪz(ə)m/ </td><td>Communism</td></tr>
<tr><td>/ˈrʌnɪŋ/ </td><td>Running</td></tr>
</table>
 <br>

<p><span> Activity 4.11 </span></p>
<p>1.	Transcribe and place stress on the following syllables.
<p>Rough, catch, doctor, defend, fantastic, compute, journalist, understand, affordable, vegetation, hospitality, conservatory, opinionated, materialism, autobiography, industrialization.
<p>Syllables and stress are two of the main areas of spoken language. Pronouncing words with the stress on the correct syllables will help you improve your spoken English, Make your sentences easier to understand and help you sound more like a native speaker.
<p>English syllables are stress-timed. English is classed as a “stress based” language which means the meanings of words can be altered significantly by a change in stress; this is why it is important to learn how to use word stress in English and develop an understanding of sentence stress and English stress patterns. 
<p>The English language is heavily stressed with each word divided into syllables. Consider the following examples. 
<p>The – (one syllable) 
<p>Eat – (one syllable) 
<p>Plant - (one syllable) 
<br>
<p>Me-ter (two syllables)
<p>Ba-by (two syllables) 
<p>Un-der (two syllables) 
<p>Hap-py (two syllables) 
<p>But-ter (two syllables)  
<p>Pu-zle (two syllables) 
<p>Ti-tle (two syllables) 
 <br>
<p>mas-sa-cre (three syllables)
<p>Un-sharp-en (three syllables) 
<p>Fan-tas-tic (three syllables) 
<p>Won-der-ful (three syllables) 
<p>Gra-vi-ty (three syllables) 
<p>ge-ni-us (three syllables) 
<br>
<p>Re-me-mber-ing (four syllables)
<p>Me-mo-ran-dum (four syllables) 
<p>in-cre-di-bly (four syllables)
<p>ra-di-at-or (four syllables)
<br> 
<p>a-bbre-vi-a-ted (five syllables) 
<p>au-tho-ri-ta-ri-an (six syllables) 
<br>
<p>Syllables may also be categorized into open syllables, closed syllables, multi-letter vowel syllables, consonant+ le syllables (or consonant + re syllables) vowel +R syllables.

<p><span>1.	Open syllables </span></p>
<p>An open syllable occurs when a vowel is at the end of the syllable, resulting in the long vowel sound. For example, pa/per, e/ven, go and we. Open syllables include a single letter vowel which occurs at the end of the syllable. This syllable pattern follows the spelling rules; A, E, O, U; usually say their names at the end of the syllable as in me, cry, ta-ble, protest etc.
<p><span>2.	Closed syllables</span></p> 
<p>Closed syllable occurs when a syllable ends with a consonant, resulting in a <p>short vowel sound. For example, cat, sit, got and wet. A closed syllable includes a single letter vowel; but the syllable ends in a consonant. In this case the single letter vowel results its short sound. Other examples are such as, duck, patch, hap-pen, din-ner etc.
<p><span>3.	Multi-letter vowel syllables.</span></p>
<p>Multi-letter vowel syllables are two or more letter working together to form a single vowel phonograph. (igh, ea, ui, oa, etc).  For example, night, read, fruit and boat. 
<p><span>4.	Consonant + lesyllables (or consonant +re)</span></p>
<p>These words have final syllable with a silent final E. they follow the spelling rule. Every syllable must have a written vowel. For example, ti-tle, puz-zle, un-cle, drib-ble, a-cre, mas-sa-cre etc.
<p><span>5.	Vowel +R syllables</span></p> 
<p>The consonant R often distorts the vowel sound of the preceding vowel. These syllables include the phonograms, ar, er, ir, or, ur, ear, wor. For example, car, her, bird, born, surface, early, word.


<h3><a name="in"></a></h3>
<p><span>Intonation</span></p> 
<p>Intonation is crucial for communication. I is also a largely unconscious mechanism and as such a complex aspect of pronunciation.
<p>It is not surprise that many students do not feel confident about tackling it in the classroom and in the exams as well. However, when teaching grammar or lexis, we find ways of making the language accessible to our learners. How then to do this with intonation?
<p>i)	What is intonation?
<p>ii)	Why teaching intonation?
<p>iii)	How Can I improve my own awareness on;
<p>a)	Intonation and grammar
<p>b)	Intonation and attitudes 
<p>c)	Intonation and discourse.
<p>In linguistics, intonation is the variation in spoken pitch when used not for distinguishing words, but rather for a range of other functions such as indicating the attitudes and emotions of the speaker, signaling the difference between statements and questions, focusing attention on important elements of the spoken message and also helping to regulate conversational interaction. This concept is also known as tone.
<p>The term tone is used by some linguists in their descriptions of intonation, but to refer to the pitch movement found on the nucleus or tonic syllable in an intonation unit.
<p>Although intonation is primarily a matter of pitch variation, it is important to be aware that functions attributed to intonation such as the expression of attitudes and emotions or highlighting aspects of grammatical structures almost involve concomitant variation in other prosodic features. 
<p>Intonation is not a single system of contours and levels, but the product of the interaction of features from different prosodic systems, tone, pitch, range, loudness, rhythmicality and tempo in particular.

<p><span>Types of intonation</span></p> 
<p>Intonation describes how the voice rises and falls in speech. The three main patterns of intonation in English are falling intonation, rising intonation and fall-rise intonation.

<p>1.	Falling intonation 
<p>Falling intonation describes how the voice falls on the final stressed syllable of a phrase or a group of words. A falling intonation is very common in Wh-questions. Consider the examples below. 
<p>- Where is the nearest most office?
<p>- What time does the film finish?

<p><span>Uses of falling intonation.</span></p>
	
<p>i.	We use falling intonation when we say something definite, or when we want to be very clear about something. 

<p>Consider the following examples.
<ul>
<p>i)	I think we are completely lost
<p>ii)	 Ok, here is the magazine you wanted 
<p>iii)	When are you leaving?
<p>iv)	Who is being paying the bills?
<p>v)	Where do they live?
<p>vi)	Where should I park?
<p>vii)	Who should she stay with?
<p>viii)	Who owns this bag?
<p>ix)	Who do you love most?
</ul>
<p>Wh-questions begins with what, when, where, who, whom, and how. We use them to ask for information; the answer cannot be yes or no. Again these are special questions.
<p>ii.	It is used in statements (declarative sentences).
 <p>Consider the examples below.
 	<ul>
<p>-We live in `DAR- es-salaam 
<p>-She is ten years `OLD

<p>Falling intonation is used for asking and giving information in normal, quite, unemphatic style. At the same time, falling intonation conveys certain emotions such as completion, finality, confidence etc. Falling intonation sounds more categorical, confident and convincing than rising intonation. Falling intonation means that the pitch falls with time.  

<p>2.	Rising intonation 
<p>Rising intonation describes how the voice rises at the end of a sentence. It is common in yes-no questions, rising intonation means the pitch of the voice rises with time. Consider the following examples.

<p>-  Are you thirst?
<p>- I hear the health centre is expanding. So, is that the new doctor?

<p>Uses of rising intonation (tone)

<p>English rising intonation is rather complicated phenomenon. It can express various emotions, such as non–finality, incompleteness, questions, surprise, doubt, hesitation, interest, request, suggestion, politeness, readiness to continue the conversation, lack of confidence and even insecurity.
<p>Rising intonation is quite difficult to describe in words. When we speak, our voices do much more than rise or fall, the sentence may start higher or lower; stressed syllables may be stronger or weaker, higher or lower, louder or quieter, quicker or slower etc.  The unstressed syllables may remain at the same level as the stressed syllable before them or go higher or lower and the voices are different too. All these factors interact intonation. 
<p>For the purpose of studying, we can say that rising intonation is used for the emotions mentioned above, but you should understand that rising intonation in different situations may sound differently. For example, a rise expressing surprise may sound a little different from a rise expressing polite interest or a rise asking to repeat.

<p>3.	Fall-rise intonation (tone)
<p>Fall-rise intonation describes how the voice falls and then rises. We use fall-rise intonation at the end of statements when we want to say that we are not sure or when we may have more to add. Examples are given below.

<p>-It rained everyday in the first weeks (but things improved after that)
<p>-I don’t support any football team at the moment (but I may change my mind in future)

<p>We use fall-rise intonation with questions, especially when we request information or invite somebody to do or to have something. The intonation pattern makes the question sound more polite.  Again consider examples below

<p>-Is this your camera?
<p>-Would you like another coffee?
<p>In short, fall-rise intonation describes how the voice falls and then rises.

<p>4.	Rise-fall intonation
<p>This tone (intonation) describes how the sound rises and then falls. We use rise-fall intonation for choices, lists, unfinished thoughts and conditional sentences. Look at the following examples. 
<p>i)	Choices (alternative questions)
<p>a)	Are you having soup or salad?
<p>b)	Is john leaving on Thursday of Friday?
<p>c)	Does he speak German or French?
<p>d)	Is your name Ava or Eva?

<p>ii)	Lists
<p>a)	We have got 
<p>Apples,
<p>Pears,
<p>Bananas and 
<p>Oranges.

<p>b)	The sweater comes in 
<p>Blue,
<p>White,
<p>Pink and black.

<p>c)	I like 
<p>Football,
<p>Tennis,
<p>Basketball and volleyball.
		
<p>d)	I bought a
<p>Tee-shirt,
<p> skirt and a handbag 

<p>iii)	Unfinished thoughts (partial statements)
<p>In the response to the following questions, the rise-fall intonation indicates reservation; the speaker hesitates to fully express his/her thoughts, for example;
<p>-Do you like my new handbag? 
<p>(Well, the leaser is nice…..but I don’t like it)

<p>-What was the meal like?
<p><p> (Hmm, the fish was good….but the rest wasn’t great)

<p>-So you both live in Los Angeles?
<p>(Well, Alex does…..but I don’t).

<p>iv)	Conditional sentences
<p>The tone rises in the first clause and falls gradually in the second clause. For example, 
<p>-If he calls, ask him to leave a message 
<p>-Unless he insists, I’m not going to go.
<p>-If you have any problem just contact us.


<p><span>Activity 4.12</span></p>

<p>How does the speaker feel?
<p>a)	Happy and excited 
<p>b)	Sad and worried
<p>c)	Nervous and worried
<p><p>2.	What type of emotion can be expressed through intonation from the following scenarios;
<p>a)	Meeting a friend for the first time in years

<p>Conversation and Communication 
<p>Human being communicated before the development of language and even today people are sharing their thoughts, feelings and opinions through various non-verbal means such as signs and symbols, body language, facial expression, eye contact, writing etc. However, communicating through verbal means using a spoken language is the effective way of expressing ideas and opinions. A conversation also falls into the same category of verbal expression but it requires as social skills to relate to the other persons opinions or points of speech.  
<p>Engaging in a conversation does not require any intellect and all it needs is a topic on which the people can relate each other to express their ideas. It requires instant feedback or quick responses for a conversation to continue, communications may happen either verbally or through other means like emails, text messages, letters, phone calls etc. 
<p>The important thing to note is people make conversation in order to communicate.  
<p>Which is more effective conversation or communication?
<p>Many people think that having the ability to converse is similar as being able to communicate effectively. Also there is a misconception among people that if one speaks effectively, they can influence other person’s behaviours. This is entirely wrong as having a conversation without a sense of direction will only delay the decision making process, resulting in wastage of time and resources.
<p>Many great conversations happen in social and literacy groups where people engage in interacting with each other to increase their proficiency, exchange knowledge and accomplish an intended consequence. 
<p>How a conversation become effective communication?
<p>A conversation becomes effective communication only if there is a transformation of thoughts and words into meaningful actions. It focuses on what we wish to accomplish that produces “win-win” situation, but not what we wish to share without formulated direction.
<p>A person may be good in communicating things, but he may be poor in conversing with people to share his/her ideas, feelings, experiences and imaginations.

	<h3><a name="pisdi"></a></h3>
<p><span>Participating in social discussions.</span></p>
<p>Participating in social discussion is an important thing in moulding individual’s understanding. Participating in social discussions is an ability to interact with others. it implies that a person is able to participate or get involved in “social interaction.”
<p>Therefore, social discussion (social interaction) Skills include, social communication, non-verbal skills, understanding and recognizing emotions, participating in conversation, cooperation with others and conflict resolution. Social discussion (social interaction) are very important in many areas of school life, including;
<p>i)	Participating in and understanding group work.
<p>ii)	Modulating behaviour across environments; including the play ground and classroom.
<p>iii)	Interpreting the intent of others interactions.
<p>iv)	Understanding sarcasm, humour, idioms and metaphors
<p>v)	Understanding rules of relationships; for example, peers, teachers, and other adults in a school setting.
<p> The useful thing with social discussion (social interaction) is that all members should participate by doing. 
<p>On the other hand, for effective interaction to take place as in communication, people should observe the following things. 
<p>i)	Posing a topic
<p>People in conversation need to pose a certain topic through which discussion is going to take place. The topic should reflect the environment through which conversators live. For example, topics from social, political, economical and cultural grounds are then most preferable; some of the specific topics might be HIV/AIDS pandemic, corruption; hunger etc. posing a topic on the hand will automatically commence or initiate the talks or conversation. 
<p>ii)	Discussing ideas.
<p>Here is where different interlocutors or participants in the conversation discuss or generate different ideas about the topic itself; for example, the topic “how to eliminate hunger” might be discussed in detail in order for everyone to come through with answers.
<p>In discussing of different thoughts (ideas), people do also present the work; meaning that they also undergo presenting their ideas; therefore we can say discussion becomes most serious following the ideas/thoughts being presented. So, discussion precedes ideas or thoughts being presented. Presenting thoughts might possibly stand alone as a considerable aspect in social interaction (social discussion) but in a normal circumstance, it seems connected together with discussion.


<p>iii)	Summarizing/ending a discussion
<p>In most cases speakers/interlocutors do end the discussion; in ending the discussion the most important thing to consider includes the topic itself, points or arguments given, evidences provided, relevance, usefulness of the topic as well as agreement reached among the two parties involved in a speech. However try to end a conversation in a way that does not cause conflict or dissatisfaction to the other side involved in that speech. Therefore in ending, one should use a very neutral language that maintains health relationship, but ending with a stronger conclusion that reflects the whole discussion; and that which reflects the real life situation of the people.

<p><span>Ways to select a topic for a speech </span></p>

<p>1.	Consider the occasion
<p>The occasion for the speech can go a long way in helping you determine the topic. Your speech topic will vary depending on whether the occasion is celebratory, just plain fun, profession etc.
<p>2.	Consider your purpose
Your purpose should be related to the occasion and the goal you want to achieve. Through you’re your speech, your purpose can be to inform, persuade or just to entertain your audience. 

<p>3.	Know which topic to avoid 
<p>If you want to select a topic that suits your purpose and is relevant to the occasion, then you should eliminate a variety of topics before you even start brainstorming ideas. This will make easier for you not to offend or just bore your audience as you move forward with your ideas in speech. 
<p>4.	Consider the knowledge of your audience 
<p>If you want to connect to your audience then you should consider their knowledge before you select a topic.
<p>5.	Consider the level of education of your audience 
<p>If you are speaking at a conference for young professionals, you can use more complicated terms and elaborate phrases, but if you are delivering a speech to middle school students, you will have to change your terms and phrasing to connect to your audience. 
<p>You should not lose your audience by speaking about something that is completely over their heads or by delivering content in such a way that it sounds condescending. 
<p>6.	Consider the needs and interests of your audience.
<p>What would your audience need to know and what would interest your audience? Put yourself in your audience’s shoes and make a list of all of the things the audience would care about.

<p>7.	Consider the demographics of your audience 
<p>Knowing the age, gender, and race of the members in your audience can help you to influence your topic. If most of your audience is over the age of 65, then you probably wouldn’t talk about current fashion trends on the runway. If most of your audience is under the age of 20 then you wouldn’t talk about saving for retirement. 
<p>8.	Consider the audience relationship to you 
<p>If you are giving a speech to friends or family, then you can be more personal than you would   if you were giving a speech to an audience of strangers. If you are giving a speech to your employees, your tone would be differently than it would be, if you were giving a speech to your superiors. Adjust the tone and content accordingly.
<p>9.	Pick a topic that you are passionate about. 
<p>If you pick something that you are passionate about then your audience will be able to see and feel your passion. This will also make you much more excited to generate ideas for the speech and to deliver the speech.
<p>10.	Pick a topic that you are knowledgeable about.
<p>If you are giving a speech at a professional conference, then it is logical that you would pick a topic that you are an expert on, so that you can give credibility to your speech.
<p>11.	Pick a topic that relates to your interest
<p>Make a list of all of your hobbies and interests and see what would make for an engaging speech topic, you may find a large overlap between the things you are interested in and the things you know.

<p><span>Participating in a debate</span></p> 
<p>A debate is a discussion or structured contest about an issue or a resolution. It is a process that involves formal discussion on a particular topic. In a debate opposing arguments are put forward to argue for opposing viewpoints.
<p>In a debate two sides speaks alternatively for and against a particular contention usually based on a topical issue.
<p>Unlike the arguments you might have with your family or friends however, each person is allocated a time they are allowed to speak for; and any interjections are carefully controlled.
<p>Debate occurs in;
<p>i)	Public meetings 
<p>ii)	Academic institutions 
<p>iii)	Legislative assemblies 
<p>While debating, one should consider the following;
<p>i)	Analysis. Identifying and arguing the major issue of the debate. 
<p>ii)	Reasoning. Effectively creating clash by arguing and presenting one side of the debate, extending an argument, turning the opponents’ arguments against them, exposing faulty logic etc.
<p>iii)	Evidence. Quality of sources, applying the evidence to a specific argument, using evidence to support major arguments, and showing how well the evidence is understood.
<p>iv)	Organization. Structure of the spoken presentation. For example, the introduction, the arguments and summary. There should be good structure of presentation to enhance profound understanding of the ideas or arguments in a debate.
<p>v)	Refutation. Effectively weakening the opponents’ arguments, creating clash and addressing all arguments in the debate.
<p>vi)	Delivery. Vocal clarity, correct pronunciation, poise, gestures, eye contact, projection of personality, sentence structure and grammar.
<p>vii)	Conclusion. This is where you wrap up your main points.
<p>In a debate, the topic to be discussed or debated is called a motion. A motion is thus a subject matter of the debate.
<p>Again while debating, the speakers should consider some skills like style of presentation, speed, tone, volume, clarify, use of notes and eye contact, content, case (argument), the whole conclusion etc.
<p>All the above skills are included within the three major steps of debating which includes the following. 
<p>i.	Greeting the audience 
<p>The main speaker in debate before going to the subject matter, he/she must make sure that he first provides greetings to the audience in order to attract attention of the listeners. A greeting starts with words like dear ladies and gentlemen …………. I am here to oppose or support the motion which states …………..  
<p>ii.	Main body 
<p>This is the part where the main speakers of the debate gives strong views, ideas or points which either supports or opposes the subject matter (motion). Here the speaker uses expressions such as to support the motion as mentioned, I agree that “HIV/AIDS is a source of poverty in our country- Tanzania, due to the following points…………. 
<p>iii.	Conclusion
<p>The main speakers should show that they have reached the end of their arguments; so as to give chance for the debate leaders allow questions from the other side of the debate participants. Concluding expressions are for example, as mentioned above, HIV/AIDS cause poverty in our country…………………
<p>Leaders of the debate
<p> The debate as a serious/formal discussion involves the following leaders.
<p>1.	Chairman 
<p>The chairman is the one who controls the debate. He/she has a power to decide anything he sees in a debate. The chairman is an important figure in a debate which ensures effective and peaceful running of the debate without any violence/conflict.
<p>2.	Secretary 
<p>The secretary is the one who writes minutes/points or ideas in a debate. He/she writes or takes note of all ideas from both sides of the debate; a secretary should not be biased while taking ideas from both sides.
<p>3.	Timekeeper 
<p>The time keeper is the one who ensures that time is being observed as agreed. In most of the school debates, main speakers are given five (5) minutes. Thereby a timekeeper will alert that person speaking that time he/she has given is over.
<p>Presenting speeches 
<p>A speech is the communication or expression of thoughts in spoken words. A speech can be presented at the conversation, graduation, guest of honour, celebration etc. 
<p>A speech is human vocal communication using the phonetic combinations of a limited set of perfectly articulated and individualized vowel and consonant sounds that form the sound of words characteristic of a language; that is, all English words sound different from other languages. A speech is among of the means of communication.
<p>While presenting a speech
<p>While presenting a speech in front of the mass (audience), consider the following important aspects.
<p>a)	Smile and make eye contact 
<p>While presenting a speech, you should smile and face your audience. If you smile and make eye contact you are building rapport which helps the audience to connect with you and your subject. It also helps you to feel less nervous because you are talking to individuals, not to a great mass of unknown people.
<p>b)	Use your voice effectively 
<p>When presenting, make the spoken words better by using your voice effectively. Varying the speed at which you talk and emphasizing changes in pitch and tone; all help to make your voice more interesting and hold your audience’s attention.
<p>c)	Use your body language 
<p>It has been estimated that more than three quarters of communication is non-verbal. This means that as well as your tone of voice, your body language is crucial to getting your message across. Make sure that you are giving the right messages. The body language to avoid includes crossed arms, hands held behind your back or in your pockets and pacing the stage. 
<p>d)	Relax, breathe and enjoy 
<p>When presenting, it is better to relax (be flexible), slow down your breath and make sure that you are breathing fully. Make sure that you continue to pause for breath occasionally during your presentation.
<p>Activity 4.13 
<p>1.	Write a brief definition of a speech on the following aspects
<p>(i)	HIV/AIDS 
<p>(ii)	English language 
<p>(iii)	Pronunciation 
<p>(iv)	Linguistic 
<p>(v)	Competence 
<p>Example of sample speeches. 
<p>Carefully observe the following speeches and evaluate on their strengths and weaknesses.
<p>It’s my life 
<p>My name is Anna Smith. I am senior in high school. Everyone can agree that I am a good student and that I like to study. My favorite subjects are history and English. I am going to enter the university because my goal is to study these subjects in future and to become a respected professional in one of the field. 
<p>I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting individuals. I enjoy my time at school; it is really nice to study, the students are very friendly and ready to help. I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine. 
<p>My friends say that I am a very funny and an interesting girl with a good sense of humour. As soon as I meet new people who are happy to meet me, I feel extremely comfortable with them. I believe that friendship is one of the most important values in human life. We exchange new ideas, find many interesting things about each other and experience new things. I appreciate friendship and people who surround me. 
<p>Meeting new people who support all my efforts to grow and develop my skills not only in the subjects but also in my hobbies gives me a lot of energy, many of those friends who surround me now I met on the street while doing my bobby. I am in love with photography, so the thing I love doing so much become even more enjoyable. I decide to take beautiful pictures of accidental people and share these photos with them by emails or in social media. I feel happiness inside seeing how happy they are looking at the pictures where they are walking or setting somewhere in the park. In this way, Liza became my best friend and we both believe that we meant to meet because she studies the same class and we have similar life goals.
<p>The goal I am currently striving for is to make this world a better place to live in by starting the changes with myself self.  Sure,
<p>I’ve had bad experiences in my life; but this is exactly what made me the way I am now, grateful, full of love, with a desire to study well because it will help me become a successful person in future and have a high quality of life. I believe that it is manifesting day by day and I feel even more responsible for what I do and where I go. 
<p>With all, I already have, I know that I’m on the right path and I will do my best to inspire others to live the way they feel like living as well. 
<p>Love
<p>What is love? It can be distinguished as a meaningful thing for all of us. Each of us desires to know this special feeling and to be significant for somebody too.
<p>Essentially each person can feel love. Nevertheless it is tricky, because love usually makes us believe that people we love have characteristics they actually do not posses. From the other hand it is love that helps us find good qualities in people we are in love with. Only true love can change people 
<p>This feeling can help us find our own pleasure when we see that the person we love is happy and satisfied. Love stories prove that those who are in love are capable of doing heroic things. The feeling of love cheers us and fills our lives with a positive sense. Because of it, we can easily look at our lives differently; help us gain news strengths and creative forces. 
<p>Meanwhile, love may be a complicated and a controversial feeling as it may cause both happiness and bitter sweet. Everything is not as simple as it may seem. This is the reason why most artists describe the feeling of being in love like standing at the edge of the chasm. Every human is different and we all express our feelings individually.
<p>The very notion of love has a completely different meaning to different people. But we all love and want to be loved and this homogeneous motive lies in all of us.
<p>Main part of oral speech 
<p>Oral speech is also known as oral presentation; it simply involves explaining something orally to the audience in the classroom, teachers grade these oral presentations based on the quality of the information presented as well as the method used in presenting it. Making a good oral presentation is an art that involves attention to the needs of your audience, careful planning and attention to delivery. It also covers use of notes, visual aids etc. 
<p> There are three main parts of oral presentation (speech). These include the following.
<p>1.	Introduction 
<p>The introduction should include a hook to interest the listener. It might be a story, quotation, rhetorical question, hypothetical or direct situation or a startling fact or statistic. An introduction also establishes relevance and credibility. Tell your audience why the speech matters. If you need to establish your credentials as an authority on the topic, this is the part of a speech to do that. The thesis gives your audience a preview of your main points. For example, you might introduce a speech on driving fast, like this; 
<p>According to the state highway patrol, driving over the speed limit is the cause of over half of all fatal crashes; and I am not different. My sister died last year in a wreck caused by speeding, I will discuss the hazards of speeding and discuss practical ways to slow down.
<p>2.	Main body 
<p>The main body of the speech discusses the details of the speech’s main points. It also includes transitions to help the reader follow you. For example, you might say, “Now that we have discussed the reasons to not drive fast. Let us turn our attention to ways to decrease the speed. The points you make during the body of the speech should be short and concise. 
<p>3.	Conclusion 
<p>Finally, it is the conclusion. The conclusion restates your main points and includes the clincher, which encourages the listener to think about the topic more deeply and to take action on it.
<p>For instance, today we have discussed the hazards of driving too fast and ways to prevent it. Now, please reflect on your own driving habits to see if you can save some one’s life by slowing down.
<p>Types of speeches 
<p>Speeches are of different types depending on their purpose. The common types include the following.
<p>i)	Informative speech 
<p>Informative speaking generally centres on talking about people, events, processes, places or things. Informing an audience about one of these subjects without being persuasive is often a difficult task to complete. For example, a speech informing an audience about growing peace lilies, as house plants might ultimately persuade the audience to buy and grow peace lilies. All speeches have an effect that might enable individuals to self-persuade themselves.
<p>In brief informative speech intends at informing people on what they do not know. 
<p>Examples:
<p>i)	A teacher telling students about earthquakes 
<p>ii)	A student talking about his research 
<p>iii)	A computer programmer speaking about new software 
<p>iv)	A travelogue about the tower to London.
<p>v)	It provides the information to people who do not know it.

<p>ii)	Persuasive speech 
<p>Persuasive speaking is the type of speaking that most people engage in the most. This type of speech can involve everything from arguing about politics to talking about what to eat for dinner.
<p>Persuasion obviously is not entirely controlled by the speaker. Persuasion occurs when an audience assents to what a speaker says. Consequently persuasive speaking requires extra attention to audience analysis.  Persuasive speaking is also speaking to influence people follow what you say.
<p>A persuasive speech works to convince people change in some way they think, the way they do something or to start doing something that they are not currently doing. Some examples of persuasive speeches. 
<p>-	Become an organ donor 
<p>-	Improve your health through better eating 
<p>-	Become the volunteer and change the world
<p>-	Television violence is negatively influencing our children.

<p>iii)	Demonstrative speeches
<p>This has many similarities with an informative speech. A demonstrative speech also teaches you something, the main difference lies in, includes a demonstration of how to do the thing you are teaching. Some examples of demonstrative speeches include.
<p>-How to start your own blog 
<p>-How to bake a cake 
<p>-How to write a speech.

<p>iv)	Entertaining speech 
<p>It is sometimes called the after-dinner-speech, it is a typical example of an entertaining speech. The speaker provides pleasure and enjoyment that make the audience laughs or identify with anecdotal information. Some examples of entertaining speeches are given below
<p>a)	Excuse for any occasion 
<p>b)	Explaining cricket to an American 
<p>c)	How to buy a condom discreetly 
<p>d)	Things you wouldn’t know without the movies.

<p>v)	Expository speech
<p>An expository speech is simply an explanation of how something works or the steps of how to do something. An expository speech follows some guidelines to be both informative and interesting. It makes people aware with a certain situation in the surrounding. Expository speech requires you to offer your audience specific, precise details in a clear and logical order.
<p>Consider the following examples 
<p>a)	What is pod casting?
<p>b)	How a plane stays in the air?
<p>c)	What is poi (used in fire dancing)?
<p>d)	What is Wicca and what are some of its ceremonies?
<p>e)	Different meaning of gestures in different cultures. Like handshakes, hugs, kissing etc.
<p>f)	When did Chemical and biological war fare begin? (Some say in 425 BC) 
<p>Descriptive speech
<p>Descriptive speech intends at describing things, objects and events. It just deals with describing and not giving reasons. The goal of descriptive speech is to speak about an object, vent or phenomenon in a way that the audiences are able to visualize the image that is portrayed by the speaker.  
<p>Consider the following examples. 
<p>a)	The heights of the building in yards or meter
<p>b)	The ingenious type of construction 
<p>c)	The huge pedestrian mall with cascading pools.
<p>d)	The almost unlimited number of levels and elevators.

<p><span>Meetings </span></p>
<p>In a meeting two or more people come together to discuss one or more topics, often in a formal setting. A meeting is therefore a gathering of two or more people that has been convened for the purpose of achieving a common goal through verbal interaction, such as sharing information or reaching agreement. Meeting may occur face-to-face or virtually as mediated by communication technology, such as telephone conference call, a skyped conference call or a video conference. 
<p>One can distinguish a meeting from other gatherings such as a chance encounter (not convened), a sports game or a concert (verbal interaction is incidental), a party or the company of friends; no common goal is to be achieved.
<p>Types of meetings

<p>1.	  How is agenda important in the meeting? 
<p>Job interviews 
<p>An interview is a conversation where questions are asked and answers are given. In clear language, the word interview refers to a one –on-one conversation with one person acting in the role of the interviewer and the other in the role of the interviewee. The interviewer asks questions, the interviewee responds; with participants taking turns taking.
<p>Interview usually involves a transfer of information from interviewee to interviewer which is usually the primary purpose of interview; although information transfer can happen in both directions simultaneously.
<p>Types of interview 
<p>Every employer has a preferred style of obtaining the information they need for their hiring decision. These are some basic types of interview style you may encounter. Some employers may choose to utilize a combination of different styles but as long as you have prepared well for your interview, you will be able to adapt to the situation they present. 
<p>1.	Structured interview   
<p>Structured interview is the one in which a particular set of predetermined questions are prepared by the interviewer in advance. It is also known as closed interview, since it has a set of questions to be administered (answered) by the respondents. 
<p>.	Unstructured interview 
<p>Unstructured interview refers to an interview in which the questions to be asked to the respondent are not set in advance. It is also termed as open interview, since there are no predetermined questions; rather face-to-face questions are asked to the respondent or an interviewee.
<p>Unstructured interview is the one that does not use any fixed format; however, the interviewer may have a few planned questions prepared beforehand. It is a qualitative research method in which the questions are prepared during the interview. As the interview is unplanned, it has an informal approach where friendly conversation takes place between the interviewer and interviewee.
<p>The interviewer has the freedom to ask any question and can also change the sequence or skip some questions that are planned in advance. However, it lacks uniformity. Further, the interviewer should possess deep knowledge and skills on the subject.


<p>Activity 4.17
<p>1.	In groups, prepare a structured interview in which some members will act as interviewers and others as interviewees.
<p>The key differences between structured and unstructured interview. 
<p>The differences between structured and unstructured interview can be drawn clearly on the following grounds.
<p>1.	Structured interview refers to an interview in which questions to be asked to the candidates are fixed in advance. Unstructured interview is an interview in which the questions to be asked to the candidates are rare and not prepared beforehand.

<p>2.	 As the structured interview is a pre-planned and the same set of questions are put to all the candidates, so the data collected is quantitative in nature. As opposed to an unstructured interview, where in different questions are put to different candidates, so qualitative data is collected.

<p>3.	In descriptive research, the structured interview is used to collect information, because it is relatively economical and the inferences can be drawn easily. On the contrary in exploratory research unstructured interview is used as the basic tool for collecting information.

<p>4.	In a structured interview, the questions put before the candidate are close-ended, that demands a certain piece of information from applicants or in fact he/she has to make a choice among various options provided. As against this, in unstructured interview, the questions are open- ended, that can be answered in multiple ways, which means the candidate is free to give thoughtful answers and thus influence the interviewer.

<p>5.	Structured interviews are used by positivists where as unstructured interviews are used by interpretivists.

<p>6.	The structured interview is used for validating results when the number of candidates is quite large. Unlike unstructured interview which is used to probe personal details of the candidate, so as to judge if he/she is the right person for the job.

<p>7.	In a structured interview, the characteristics evaluated are explicit which on the other side are implicit in an unstructured interview.

<p>8.	In structured interview there is a pre-developed system or guide to check the results. As against this, there is no such pre-developed system or guide for checking interview results.
<p>Therefore, when the interview is structured, some questions are put before the candidates, which are job-related. On the contrary, when the interview is unstructured, questions may differ from interviewee to interviewee for the same job which may or may not be related to the job.
<p>Things to consider before your job interview 
<p>So you have got a job interview. Congratulations. Now, the real work begins.
<p>Here are things you should consider before any job interview.
<p>1.	What the organization does 
<p>Do not show up knowing nothing about the organization. Do your research; find out what their products are, what they do, what their mission and values are. The more you know about the organization and its products and industry, the more impressive you will seem. It shows that you care enough about the opportunity and your profession, to put in the research and learn, and all hiring managers like a person like that.
<p>2.	What the role involves 
<p>What is the job? It goes without saying but you should be well-acquainted with the organization’s job description. It also however, can serve as the foundation of your interview. 
<p>What are the required skills and qualification? How does your experience match up? More importantly can you think of instances or achievements that best demonstrates them? Be prepared to give examples and you will stand out from the crowd.
<p>Doing this kind of research can also help you come up with questions for the interviewer. Is there anything in the job description that you would like to know more about? Ask the question.
<p>3.	Who your interviewer is?
<p>It is good that you will know your interviewer’s name. How long have they been in the role? Do you have anything in common? Not only will this help you come up with good conversation starters, it also helps you psychologically prepare for the task at hand.
<p>4.	Where the organization is and exactly how to get there.
<p>Start by knowing exactly how to get where you need to be and how long it will take you and leave extra time for unforeseen circumstances. 
<p>5.	What the people are like?
<p>Do your best to find out what people wear to work and what sort of environment it is. Are they socially conscious? Getting a sense of the crowd can help you decide how far you want to seem like those people. Decide whether you want or you do not want to work with these people after all.
<p>6.	How the organization is doing?
<p>Ask yourself how the industry, company or organization is doing and what challenges the organization might face. Is the organization, industry or company doing well? Is the organization facing any problems/challenges? Knowing this will help you assess what challenges they might be facing and if you are in a position to do so, come up with some solutions to present. If your role is not directly related to finding solutions, you should still at least be aware of what is going on. 
<p>7.	Prepare your questions 
<p>When asked by the interviewer if you have any questions, have a few ideas up your sleeve. This demonstrates that you are prepared, enthusiastic and committed to the role and the organization. Try to think of less obvious, but interesting questions that will set you apart from other candidates. 
<p>8.	Practice your interview technique 
<p>Think beforehand about how you can best demonstrate your skills and experiences in an interview. This can make you feel more confident on the day. If you have been asked to give a presentation as part of the interview process, give it. 
<p>9.	Do not forget print outs 
<p>Make sure you have got print outs of your CV with you as well as any other supporting information; like references or a portfolio. Pop a notepad and pen in your bag just in case you need to write anything down.

<p>10.	 Dress appropriately 
<p>Make sure you dress appropriately for the job interview, you must look professional.  Research the linked profile of the organization’s employees to get an idea on how they dress. Do not leave ironing clothes to the last minutes - it is best to do this the night before, so you feel as organized as possible. 
<p>11.	 Reach on time 
<p>Do not ever try to be late for the interview. It is always wise to arrive 30 minutes early before the finalized time. 
<p>It will give you some additional time to relax and carry on with some paper work if needed. If you are not aware of a particular location of the organization/company, then you may visit the office two or three weeks before. 

<p>Activity 4.18 
<p>1.	You have been called for the interview vacant what important things can you think of before attending that interview?
<p>Things to consider during the interview 
<p>1.	Mannerism and politeness
<p>These are two vital ingredients that you have to incorporate during the time of interview. Greeting every one with a warm, polite gesture. If you meet any lady, then try to behave well-mannered in front of her, remember it is the time to exhibit all the mannerism that you have learned during your school days. 
<p>2.	Do not try to crack a joke 
<p>Even if the panel members seem friendly and have impressed you in a short period, still do not take the risk of cracking an unnecessary joke. Do not do this, even if it is the end of the conversation. A bad joke can be an ugly spot in your overall personality and can create a negative impression on the interviewer. 
<p>3.	 Be attentive towards your body language
<p>Poor body language can create a lot of distractions and might disinterest the interviewer from taking the interview.
<p>Chewing gum, playing with the pen, slouching, playing with your hairs, shaking legs, biting nails and more similar gestures are signs of poor body language. 
<p>Make a strong eye contact, smile often, and nodding your head are some of the signs of a confident body language. Try to maintain a robust posture from beginning to the end of the interview.
<p>4.	Ask genuine questions 
<p>Most of the times, interviewers tend to end the whole session by permitting the candidates to ask some questions
<p>Regardless of the fact, how well you are aware of the organization and how comprehensively the interviewer has informed you about the organization’s work, culture and your job profile details, you must ask some questions. The More genuine and smart questions you may ask, the more it is going to impress the interviewer.
<p>5.	Make sure your comments are addressed.
<p>If it is a panel interview and only one member is asking the questions, still make an extra effort to ensure that all address you remarks. It is important that each and everything you are conveying is received and reacted by the panel members.
<p>6.	Use realistic examples 
<p>Whenever possible, try to support your answer with practical examples. It will provide the interviewer with a better understanding of your experiences, skills and achievements. For instance, if they ask you how you will handle an angry customer, then explain them the way you used to handle them in your previous job.
<p>7.	Do not speak about issues you faced in the previous job.
<p>Highlighting the questions (issues) you had in your previous job can indirectly create negative impact on the interviewer. Do not ever try to portray an image that you are not fit to the desired work profile and that you are not well-versed in handling problematic situations.

<p>8.	Do not say you were asked to leave; even if you were.
<p>Even if your past job experience was not so good, this does not imply that the next job will also be the same. So there is no need to say that you were fired from the job. It would end the interviewer in the confusion that why you were asked for this and may even make him conclude not to hire you even if he liked you. 
<p>9.	Keep your cell phone off.
<p>It is something that even experienced professionals tend to forget. Your interview is your first ever formal meeting with the organization or company’s delegates; and if you sincerely want that job, then you should not think of risk. Cell phone ringing in between of a vital conversation might distract or annoy the interviewer. As most interviewers do not like any disturbance in between, especially when they are in an important conversation. Remember that interview is crucial for the organization. 
<p>10.	End every answer in a positive note.
<p>The interviewer may ask you different types of questions and might be even trying to puzzle you by asking questions that do not relate to the job. No matter what kind of question is being put on, try ending it in a positive note.
<p>11.	Give best possible response to a question.
<p>Just like an examination, try to give the best possible answer to each question asked to you. Remember that your success in the interview is the only way that you can get a job. 
<p>12.	Be focused and concise 
<p>The quality of your responses is what that differentiates you from other candidates for the same profile. Possibly the same questions are put for everyone.
<p>So it is only your answer that can make you stand out of the crowd. Make sure your every answer is concise and focuses towards only one goal-grabbing the job offer.
<p>Therefore while these are the things that you need to remember during your interview, there is one more thing that you may follow after the meeting is over. A thanks note! You can either send a thanking email or can say thank you in person. Though it may not help in your short listing for the job profile, but will undoubtedly leave a positive impact on the interviewer. 
<p>Activity 4.19 
<p>1.	Are there things else to consider during your job interview? Identify and explain those things.
<p>Possible questions during interview.
<p>While some job interviewers take a fairly unusual approach to interview questions, most job interview involve an exchange of common interview questions and answers; including some of the most often-asked behavioral interview questions. Here are some of the most common interview questions along with the best way to answer them. 
<p>1.	Tell me a little about yourself 
<p>In short you should explain your history or personal details; including your education, experience, and your contribution to other organizations.
<p>2.	What are your biggest weaknesses? 
<p>Every candidate (interviewee) knows how to answer this question. Just pick a theoretical weakness and magically transform that flaw into strength in disguise.
<p>For example, “my biggest weakness is getting so absorbed in my work that I lose all track of time. Every day I look up and realize everyone has gone home. I know I should be more aware of the clock, but when I love what I’m doing I just cannot think of anything else. 
<p>So your biggest weakness is that you will put in more hours than everyone else? Great……… 
<p>3.	What is your biggest strength?
<p>Even so, if you are asked, provide a sharp, on-point answer. Be clear and precise. If you are a great problem solver, do not just say that; provide few examples that prove you are a great problem solver. If you are an emotionally intelligent leader, do not just say that, provide few examples that prove you know how to answer the unasked question.
<p>In short do not just claim to have certain attributes-prove you have those attributes. 
<p>4.	Out of all the other candidates, why should we hire you?
<p>Since a candidate cannot compare himself with people he does not know, all he can do is to describe his incredible passion, desire, commitment and other related attributes. Basically beg for a job. However, if you are asked this question, use it as a chance to highlight things you have not been able to touch on.
<p>5.	Why do you want this job? 
<p>Now go deeper, do not just talk about why the organization would be great to work for. Talk about how the position is perfect fit for what you hope to accomplish; both short- term and long-term. In short ask yourself what do you plan to do if …..?
<p>6.	What do you consider to be your biggest professional achievement?
<p>If for example you are interviewing for a leadership role in human resources, talk about an underperforming employee you “rescued” or how you overcame in fighting between departments, or how so many of your direct reports have been promoted. The goal is to share achievements that let the interviewer imagine you in the position-and see you succeeding.


<p>7.	Why do you want to leave your current job?
<p>Do not talk above how your boss is difficult. Do not talk about how you cannot get along with other employee, do not bad-mount your organization; meaning that do not talk bad things about your organization. 
<p>Instead, focus on the positives a move will bring. Talk about what you want to achieve, talk about what you want to learn, talk about things you want to grow, talk about things you want to accomplish, explain how a move will be great for you and for your new organization.
<p>Complaining about your current employer is a little like people who gossip. If you are willing to speak badly of someone else, you will probably do the same to me. 
<p>8.	What kind of work environment do you like best?
<p>May be you like working alone, but if the job you are interviewing for is in call centre, that answer will not be good to you. So, take a step back and think about the job you are applying for and the organization’s culture. If a flexible schedule is important to you, but the organization does not offer it, focus on something else. If you like constant direction and support, and the organization expect employees to self-manage; focus on something else. Find ways to highlight how the organization’s environment will work well for you-and if you cannot find ways, do not take the job, because you will be miserable.

<p>9.	What is your leadership style?
<p>This is a tough question to answer without dipping into platitudes. Try sharing leadership examples. Instead, Say the best way for me to answer that is to give you a few examples of leadership challenges I have faced; and then share situations where you dealt with a problem, motivated a team, worked through a crisis.
<p>Explain what you did and that will give the interviewer a great sense of how you lead; and of course it lets you highlight a few of your success. 
<p>10.	What was your salary in your last job?
<p>This is a tough one. You need to be open and honest, but frankly, some organizations ask this question as the opening move in salary negotiations. However, this question is not answered direct. Again in attempting to answer this question, you may tell the interviewer, the different salary scales set by your current institution or organization to different positions. On the other hand, it is advised to say, I was paid affordable salary scale. Affordable salary scale is that a scale which enables a person to afford all the basic needs; such as food, shelter, clothing and being able to do the same to his/her family; meaning that a salary scale that enables one to also take care of his family.
<p>11.	What questions do you have for me? 
<p>Do not waste this opportunity; ask smart questions, not just as a way to show you are a great candidate, but also to see if the organization is a good fit-after all, you are being interviewed, but you are also interviewing the organization. Consider the following examples.
<p>(a)	What role do you want a person under this position to accomplish?
<p>(b)	What difficulties one should expect from this position?

<p>12.	How did you hear about the position? 
<p>This is another seemingly innocuous interview question, this is actually a perfect opportunity to stand out and show your passion for and connection to the organization. For example, if you found out about the gig through a friend or professional contact, name or drop that person, then share why you were so-excited about it. If you discovered the organization through an event or article, share that. Even if you found the listening through a random job board, share what specifically caught your eye about the role. 
<p>13.	How would your boss and co-workers describe you?
<p>First of all, be honest, remember if you get this job, the hiring manager will be calling your former bosses and co-workers. Then try to pull out strengths and trait you haven’t discussed in other aspect of the interview, such as your strong work ethic or your willingness to pitch in on other projects when needed.
<p>14.	How do you deal with pressure or stressful situations?
<p>Choose an answer which shows that you can meet a stressful situation; head-on in a productive, positive manner and let nothing stop you from accomplishing your goal. A great approach is to talk through your stress-reduction tactics and then share an example of a stressful situation you navigated with ease.
<p>15.	What do you like to do outside of work?
<p>Interviewers ask personal questions in an interview to see if candidates will fit in with the culture and give them the opportunity to open up and display their personality.
<p>In other words, if someone asks about your hobbies outside of work, it is totally Ok to open up and share what really makes you tick, saying you like to have few beers on Saturday night is fine. But telling them that Monday is usually a rough day for you because you are always hung over is not recommended.
<p>Mastering and understanding these interview questions makes you perfect and fit at job. It however, gives you a greater chance to not losing a job during interview. 
<p>Exercise 4.4 
<p>1.	Assume you are one of the principal speakers in a debate with a motion DRINKING SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ARE LESS THAN 18 years old. Write a speech you think you could present.

						<h2>READING SKILLS</h2>
									
							</div>
							<br><br>
	
<p>Improving your reading skills will reduce unnecessary reading time and enable you to read in a more focused and selective manner. You will also be able to increase your levels of understanding and concentration. This topic shows you how to read with greater efficient and effectiveness by using a range of different reading skills.
<p>Reading can be classified into two major types depending on the selected text in which a reader is reading. These include the following.
<p>1.	Scanning 
<p>Scanning is the technique you might use when reading, it can be used for example, in reading a telephone directory. You pass your vision speedily over a section of text in order to find particular words or phrases that are relevant to your current task. You can scan the following;
<p>a)	The introduction or preface of a text 
<p>b)	The first or last paragraph of chapters
<p>c)	The concluding or summarizing chapter of a text 
<p>d)	The book index.

<p>2.	Skimming 
<p>Skimming is the process of speedy reading for general meaning or information. Let your eyes skip over sentences or phrases which contain detailed information. Concentrate on identifying the central or main points. Use this technique to;
<p>a)	Pre-view a selection of a text prior to detailed reading 
<p>b)	Refresh your understanding of a selection of a text following detailed reading.
<p>Therefore once you have selected a text, scanning and skimming techniques can help you identify areas for detailed reading.


<h3><a name="rfst"></a></h3>
<p><span>Reading for study (study reading) </span></p>
<p>You already use a range of reading styles in everyday situations. The normal reading style that you might use for reading for example, a novel, is to read in detail (detailed reading), focusing on every word in sequence from start to finish. If it is a magazine you are reading, you might flick through the pages to see which articles are of interest.
<p>When you look in a telephone directory for a particular name, you purposefully ignore all other entries and focus your attention on spotting the name you want. These everyday reading skills can be applied to your studies. 

	<h3><a name="htiyrsk"></a></h3>

<p><span>How to improve your reading skills?</span></p>
<p>To improve your reading skills, you need to consider the following.
<p>1)	 Have a clear reading goal 
<p>Clear reading goals can significantly increase your reading efficiency, not everything in print will be of use to you. Use reading goals to select and prioritize information according to the task in hand.
<p>Reading goals can be an essay or seminar subjects, a report brief, a selected subject area, a series of questions about a specific topic. Use your reading goals to help you identify the information that is relevant to your current task. 
<p>2)	Choose the right texts 
<p>You will need to assess the text to see if it contains information that is relevant to your reading goals.  Here you need to observe the following.  
<p>i). 	Check the date of publication. Is the information up-to-date? 
<p>ii). 	Read the publisher’s blurb at the back or inside sleeve for an overview of the content.
<p>iii).	Check the contents page for relevant chapters 
<p>iv).	Look up references for your topic in the index
<p>If the text does not seem relevant, discard it.


<p><p>3)	Use the right reading style
<p>Once you have selected a text, you can use the techniques of reading; scanning and skimming to help you identify areas for detailed reading. 
<p>Canning as introduced at the previous involves reading for specific information. On contrary, skimming involves an activity of speedy reading for general meaning.
<p>4)	Use note taking techniques 
<p>Note taking is an important thing in reading, however detailed reading and note taking goes together? 
<p>Once you have selected the useful information, you can begin to read in detail. Note taking techniques provides a useful aid to reading. Likewise, in note-taking, consider the following ways.
<p>i) 	Underlining and highlighting; to pick out what seem to you the mot central or important words and phrases. Do this in your own copy of text or on photocopies – never on borrowed texts.
<p>ii) 	Use key words to record the main headings as you read. Use one or two key words for each main point. key words can be used when you do not want to mark the text. 
<p>iii) 	Record Questions to encourage you to take an active approach to your reading, record your questions as you read. They can also be used as prompts for follow up work.
<p>iv)	Make Summaries; to check you have understood what you have read, pause after a section of a text and put what you have read in your own words. Skim over the text to check the accuracy of your summary, filling in any significant gaps. 
<p>These techniques encourage an active engagement with the text as well as providing you with a useful record of your reading. Avoid passively reading large amounts of a text; it does not make effective use of your time. Always use a note taking technique to increase your level of concentration and understanding.
<p>Mean while, readers need also to be aware with decoding, fluency, vocabulary, sentence construction and cohesion, reasoning and background knowledge as well as working memory and attention in reading. 
<p>Activity 5.1 
<p>1.	When do we ready for study?

	<h3><a name="cre"></a></h3>
<p><span>Critical reading </span></p>
<p>Critical reading is the process of reading that goes beyond just understanding a text. critical reading involves; 
<p>i)	Carefully considering and evaluating the reading 
<p>ii)	Identifying the reading’s strength and implications 
<p>iii)	Identifying the reading’s weakness and flaws
<p>iv)	Looking at the “big picture” and deciding how the reading fits into the greater academic context; the understandings presented in other books and articles on this topic.
<p>In brief you are actively responding to the reading. Critical reading is useful at all stages of academic study, but is particularly important when writing an article critique or a literature review.
<p>Critical reading often involves asking questions about the reading. In particular, you are examining the strengths and weaknesses of the reading’s arguments. To do this you need to consider the following 
<p>1.	Background 
<p>Before you consider the argument of a reading, you should build up a background picture of the reading.  Look at the following examples 
<p>i)	Who is the author?
<p>ii)	What type of source is this?
<p>iii)	Who is the audience?
<p>iv)	When was it written?

<p><p>2.	Purpose 
<p>Getting the big picture (purpose) of the reading is essential so that you can see how all the pieces fit together. Consider the examples below.
<p>i) What is the main claim of the reading?
<p>ii) What are the implications of the claim?
<p>iii) How is the reading structured?

<p>3.	Evidence
<p>It is essential to consider the quality of the evidence in the reading, as this directly relates to the usefulness of the reading. for example.
<p>i)	Is the evidence fact, researchable, opinion or personal experience?
<p>ii) 	Is the evidence accurate?
<p>iii) 	Is the evidence relevant to the conclusion?
<p>iv) 	Is the theory appropriate for this topic?

<p>4.	Methodology 
<p>If the reading is based on any kind of research like a survey, experiments, case study etc. It is important to consider how the research was conducted, as this can affect the validity of the findings reported. Look at the following examples.
<p>i)   Is the research qualitative or quantitative?
<p>ii) What was the range/sample size of the research?
<p>iii) Is the research falsifiable?
<p>iv) Is the research repeatable?
<p>v) Are there better methods?


<p>5.	Logic 
<p>When reading critically it is important to examine the chain of reasoning used by the author, as any gaps or problems can undermine the validity of the conclusion. Consider the following questions. 
<p>i) Are key terms defined?
<p>ii) Does the logic flow?
<p>iii) Are there any flaws in the reasoning?

<p>6.	Balance
<p>In order to read critically, you have to consider whether the argument is appropriately balanced, looking at the issue or problem from relevant perspectives. You can see the following questions as examples.
<p>i)   Do you have questions that are not answered in the reading?
<p>ii) Is the reading biased?
<p>iii) What other perspectives are there on this issue? 
<p>iv) Did the reading present a counter – argument?



<p>7.	Limitations  
<p>In critical reading, one should also consider the limitations or weaknesses of the text or reading. Consider the following questions as examples.
<p>i) 	What are the limitations of the theory?
<p>ii) 	What does the argument assume?

<p>8.	Other sources. 
<p>No reading exists in isolation; you must consider how the reading fits into the bigger pictures of the larger academic context. For example;
<p>i)	How does this reading relate to other readings?
<p>ii)	Are there competing theories with better explanations for the evidence?
<p>iii)	Is there more up-to-date research that could disagree with the findings or improve up them?
<p>A Critical reading means that a reader applies certain processes, models, questions and theories that result in enhanced clarity and comprehension.
<p>There is more involved, both in effort and understanding in a critical reading than in a more skimming of the text; what is the difference? If a reader “skims” the text, superficial characteristics and information are as far as the reader goes.
<p>A critical reading gets at “deep structure,” if there is such a thing a part from the superficial text; that is logical consistency, tone, organization and a number of other very important sounding terms.
<p>A critical reader is the one who becomes part of the writer’s audience, he/she prepares to read with an open mind, considers the title, reads slowly, uses the dictionary and other appropriate reference works, makes notes, keeps a reading journal etc. 

<p>ACTIVITY 5.2 
<p>1.	What does it take to be a critical reader?

	<h3><a name="ire"></a></h3>
<p><span>Intensive reading</span></p> 
<p>Intensive reading involves learners reading in detail with specific learning aims and tasks. It can be compared with extensive reading which involves learners reading a text for enjoyment and to develop general reading skills. Example, the learners read a short text and put events from it into chronological order.
<p>In the classroom, intensive reading activities includes skimming a text for specific information to answer true or false statements or filling gaps in a summary, scanning a text to match headings to paragraphs, and scanning jumbled paragraphs and then reading them carefully to put them into the correct order.
<p>In addition, intensive reading refers to reading short texts thoroughly and with clear goals such as to answer reading comprehension questions or to identify how sentences are linked. 
<p>Unlike extensive reading, the goal of intensive reading is not to read many texts for fluency but rather to read a shorter piece of a text to gain a deeper understanding of that text.
<p>Although reading comprehension can be one goal of intensive reading, its goals may include learning subject matter, vocabulary learning and studying the author’s intentions.
<p>In other words, the goal of intensive reading is not limited to reading comprehension.
<p>Again, in intensive reading, learners usually read texts that are more difficult, in terms of content and language, than those used for extensive reading.
<p>To help learners make sense of texts that may present a significant challenge in terms of vocabulary, grammar and/ or concepts, teachers should focus on reading skills such as identifying main ideas and guessing the meaning of unfamiliar words from context.
<p>Learning goals for intensive reading 
<p>The four learning goals for intensive reading are; 
<p>i)	Focusing on a new language; such as vocabulary and grammar. 
<p>ii)	Focusing on ideas; such as themes and topics. 
<p>iii)	Learning new skills; such as making inferences and identifying main ideas. 
<p>iv)	Paying attention to text features; such as genre structure and cohesion.

<p>ACTIVITY 5.3
<p>1.	Read the following text and then answer the questions that follows it 
<p>In law, trespass can be; the criminal act of going into some body’s else’s land or property without permission of the owner or lessee; it is also a civil law tort that may be a valid cause of action to see judicial relief and possibly damages through a lawsuit. In some jurisdictions, trespassing is an offence or misdemeanour covered by a criminal code.
<p>In other jurisdictions, it is not considered a crime or penal in nature, property is protected from trespass under civil law and privacy acts. In England and Wales, despite the prevalence of notices asserting that “trespassers will be prosecuted,” unless the trespass is aggravated in some way, it will only be a civil wrong. 
<p>Questions
<p>i)	What is the text about?
<p>ii)	How is property being protected? 
<p>iii)	What does the statement aggravated trespass mean?
<p>iv)	How it seems like prosecuting someone for trespass?
<p>v)	What specific meaning do you get from this text?

<h3><a name="iadiaacfate"></a></h3>
<p><span>Identifying and drawing inferences and conclusions from a text</span></p>
<p>Identifying and making inferences and conclusions happens all the time. In fact, you probably do it every time you read – sometimes without even realizing it. For example, remember the first time that you saw the movie “The lion king,” when you meet a scar for the first time, it is trapping a helpless mouse with its sharp claws preparing to eat it.
<p>When you see this action you guess that a scar is going to be a bad character in the movie; and more generally you conclude that a scar is a bad character in this movie. This is what refers to identifying and making inferences and conclusions from a text as you read. 
<p>What is a conclusion?	
<p>A conclusion is a statement in an argument that indicates of what the arguer is trying to convince the reader/listener. What is the argument trying to prove? There can be only one conclusion in a single argument. However, it is in this part that you will need to be able to distinguish premises and conclusions.
<p>The proof way to do this is to ask yourself, what the author of the argument is trying to get you believe. The answer to this question is the conclusion. Likewise, there must also be at least one reason and possibly many, these are your premises.


<p>ACTIVITY 5.4
<p>1.	Read and then answer the following arguments, listing the premise(s) first and the conclusion last. Each line should be a single statement written as a complete sentence as you deem necessary, without changing their basic meaning; after all you want to be restating this argument, not writing a new one. Label the premise(s) P1, P2, P3 etc and the conclusion C. leave out any indicator words and any fluff, meaning sentences which are neither the conclusion nor the premise.
<p>Example  
<p>Cats with long hairs shed all over the house so you should not get a long-haired cat. 
<p>I have heard that they also have lots of flees.
<p>P1  long-haired cats shed all over the house 
<p>P2  long haired cats have a lot of flees
<p>C  you should not get a long haired cat
<p>(i)	Faidale will win the championship because they have the best team 
<p>(ii)	Jesse is one year old. Most one-year-olds can walk. It follows that Jesse can walk. 
<p>(iii)	Since the housing market is depressed and interest rates are low, it is a good time to buy a home.
<p>(iv)	China is guilty of extreme human rights abuses. Further, they refuse to implement democratic reforms, thus, U.S. should refuse to deal with the present chines government.
<p>(v)	We may infer the U.S military is both capable and competent from the results of the Persian Gulf War.
<p>(vi)	I deserve a raise. I’m very good at my job.

<p>2.	Write out two arguments you have encountered in the course of your day. First write them then re-write in the format you practiced in question one (1) above. Make sure they are arguments with premises and conclusions

<h3><a name="cadme"></a></h3>	
<p><span>Connotative and Denotative Meaning </span></p>
<p>Words are not limited to one or single meaning, which are categorized as either denotative or connotative. Rather words may have more than one meaning. The denotation of a word as its explicit definition as listed in a dictionary (i.e. primary meaning). 
<p>Let us use the word “home” as an example. The denotative or literal meaning of home is a place where one lives; a residence. denotation is sometimes contrasted to connotation which includes associated meanings. The denotation meaning of a word is perceived through visible concepts where as connotational meaning evokes sensible attitudes towards the phenomena.
<p>Denotation refers to the literal meaning of a word, the “dictionary definition”.  For example, if you look up the word snake in a dictionary, you will discover that one of its denotative meanings is any of numerous scaly, legless, sometimes venomous reptile found in most tropical and temperature regions.
<p>Clearly put, denotation refers to the direct meaning of a word, in contrast to its figurative or associated meanings (connotations), the denotation of an expression is the part of reality the expression is linked to.
<p>Denotation meaning is sometimes called cognitive meaning, referential meaning or conceptual meaning. 
<p>The denotation of a term is its exact and literal meaning.  consider the word home. Its denotation or precise meaning is residence or fixed dwelling place, the denotation of a word “city” is centre of population and commerce.
<p>A word’s connotation on the other hand, consists of its emotive value. For example, connotations of the word “home” might be a refuge, resting place, even boring or predictable habitation. The word “city” might connotate a place of excitement, energy, danger or even sin. 
<p>Connotation refers to the associations that are connected to a certain word or the emotional suggestions related to that word. The connotative meaning of a word exists together with the denotative meanings. For example, the connotation for the word snake could include evil or danger.


<p>Why deviation from denotation to connotation 
<p>In literary works, we find it a common practice with writers to deviate from the dictionary meanings of words to create fresher ideas and images. Such deviations from the literal meanings are referred to as “figurative language” or “literary devices.” For example, metaphors, similes, personifications, hyperboles, understatements, paradox and puns. Even in our daily conversations, we diverge from the dictionary meaning of words, preferring connotative or associated meanings of words in order to accurately convey our messages.
<p>Consider a list below of some connotative meanings of words that we experience in our day-to-day life.
<p>Dog- suggests shamelessness or an ugly face.
<p>Home – suggests family, comfort and security.
<p>Politician - suggests negative connotation of wickedness and insincerity
<p>Dove – suggests peace and gentility.
<p>Pushy – suggests someone is loud mouthed and irritating  
<p>Mom and dad – when used instead of mother and father suggest loving parents.

<p>Activity 5.5
<p>1.	From each of the following list of words, write two sentences, one of denotative and the other of connotative. 
<p>(a)	Dog		(b) City	(c) Home	(d) Snake
<p>(e) Lion   		(f) Wall	(g) Animal	(h) Assertive 
<p>(i) in expensive   	(j) Fire 	(k) Dinner 	(l) Aside 
<p>(m) Slim		(n) Cheat 	(o) Baby 	(p) Teacher 
<p>(q) Deady 		(r) Family 	(s) Learner 	(t) Childish.

<p>Sources of information 
<p>The most easily available sources of information include our lecture notes as well as the suggested reading list for the course, provided   by the tutor or lecturer. However, the subject catalogue in the main library (libraries) and the bibliography or references at the back of any book you have obtained will make you to further works. 
Consider the following strategies, suitable to each of the information sources.
<br>
<table>

<tr><td> i) Lecture notes </td><td> i) Formulate questions e.g. what else do you need to know?</td></tr> 
<tr><td> ii)Subject catalogue </td><td>  ii) Check under suitable topics and select relevant titles.</td></tr> 
<tr><td> iii)Reading lists </td><td> iii) Consult author catalogue. </td></tr> 
<tr><td> iv)Bibliography/references </td><td> iv)Select relevant titles and consult author catalogue  </td></tr> 


<tr><td>v)Libraries </td><td>v)Consult or visit the librarian at the library</td></tr> 



<tr><td>vi)Internet </td><td>vi)Visit the internet cafe or any internet access you have</td></tr> 
</table>
<br>

<p>When using the subject catalogue, bibliography or references at the back of a book, you have to decide which books will be relevant and appropriate to your purpose. To implement this, you should observe at the title, particularly any subsidiary title which defines the content; more precisely the author, to see whether the author is known to you, the date to see how recent the book is. It is also very important to check (consider) the place of publication/ the publisher, to ensure a balanced point of view.
<p>On the other hand, the information collected from various sources and methods can be organized and then be presented, hence the information resource can be used to research a topic for presentation. 


<h3><a name="csoiuast"></a></h3>
<p><span>Citing sources of information using APA style.</span></p>
<p>Students of English language may be asked to convert or put down the given information into conventional citational or referential form. 
<p>This happens as when writing different academic works including dissertation (research papers), books, journals etc. 
<p>Again it is an important thing to acknowledge that the ideas we give are not only basing on our knowledge, rather it is also a contribution from other people’s ideas. Therefore, for that reason, there is a need of making citation for the works we put into writings. This is to show appreciation and to increase our credibility to what we say.
<p>However, appreciating other people’s ideas is what entails the so called citation. Citation is referencing; so they are the same and they are used for similar purpose; citing or referencing the ideas or views of others.  
<p><span>Why do we make citation/reference?</span></p>
<p>It is obviously well known that no research no right to speak. So even when writing, it is important to show evidences, that what is being said is a result of research. The question comes, how one proves that our work is truly from research? Here the answer is simple; through citation or references.
 <p>Making a reference or citation assists in knowing how different scholars or writers present their thoughts; or what they say about a certain phenomena. In addition making citation and references enriches the works we write due to accumulation of different ideas put together into the same work (like a book or journal)
<p>It also attracts attention of all people, say readers, to read our work, since by citing or referencing, they will find themselves being interested with a certain person else they know previously, since his ideas  are useful to them. So citation/referencing cuts across all readers’ ideas.
<p>Moreover, citation enables better verification of our work, it makes us better researchers, it makes us better writers etc. A good citation shows our scientific knowledge.
<p>Citation also makes our work more persuasive. By citing experts in your field, you are showing your maker or reader that you are aware of the filed in which you are operating.
<p>Referencing allows you to acknowledge the contribution of other writers and researchers in your work. Referencing is also a way to give credit to the writer from whom you have borrowed words and ideas. By citing the work of a particular scholar, you acknowledge and respect the intellectual property rights of that researcher.
<p>Referencing is a way to provide evidences to support the assertions and claims in your own assignments. However references should always be accurate, allowing your readers to trace the sources of information you have used. The best way to make sure you reference accurately is to keep a record of all the sources you used when reading and researching for the work.
<p>What kind of information do I need to reference?
<p>Printed books are not the only source that requires acknowledgements, any words, ideas or information taken from any source requires a reference.

<p>When to reference?</p>
<p>Reference when you are using words or ideas from.
	<ul>
<p>i)	Books and journal articles 
<p>ii)	News papers and magazines.
<p>iii)	 pamphlets or brochures 
<p>iv)	Websites or electronic resources.
<p>v)	Letters, emails, online discussions, forums etc. 
<p>vi)	Reference when you reprint any diagrams, illustrations, charts or pictures.
</ul>	
<p>When no need to reference?

<p>There are some circumstances that shows no need of referencing, these appears in the following ways
	<ul>
<p>a)	When you are writing your own observations or experiment results. For example, a report on a field trip. 
<p>b)	When you are writing about your own experiences; for example, a reflective journal. 
<p>c)	When you are writing your own thoughts, comments or conclusions in an assignment.
<p>d)	When you are evaluating or offering your own analysis.
<p>e)	When you are using common knowledge; facts that can be found in numerous places and are likely to be known by a lot of people or folklore.
</ul>
<p>The APA citing style 
<p>The APA style originated in 1929, when a group of  American psychologists, anthropologists and business managers convened and sought to establish a simple set of procedures, or style rules, that would codify the many components of scientific writing to increase the ease of reading comprehension. 
<p>As with other editorial style, APA style consists of rules or guidelines that a publisher observes to ensure clear and consistent presentation of written materials. It concerns the uniform use of such elements as selection f headings, length, punctuation, abbreviations, presentation of number and statistics, construction of tables and figures, citation of references, and many other elements that are part of manuscript. 
<p>APA in fact is the short form which stands for American psychological association. It is mostly used to cite sources within the academic fields such as in books writing, journal articles and research works.
<p>Types/ways of citation
<p>Basically, there are two ways or types of citations. The first type or style is in-text citation (also called parenthetical citation). The second style/way of citation is the reference list citation.
<p>1.	In-text citation (APA)
<p>In-text citation also called parenthetical citations; appears throughout your paper at the end of sentences that you are citing. These usually include the authors, date of publication (APA only) and page numbers being cited.
<p>How to cite-in text 
<p>How you cite a work within your document varies depending on your writing style, whether you are quoting your source directly and the type of source you are quoting.
<p>When using APA format, follow the author-date method of in text citation. This means that the author’s last name and the year of publication for the source should appear in the text. For example, citation is………… (Jones, 2009). However, a complete reference should appear in the reference list at the end of the paper.
<p>If you are referring to an idea from another work but not directly quoting the material, or making reference to an entire book, article or other work, you only have to make reference to the author and year of publication in your in-text reference. 
<p>The examples below attempts to address most of your in-text citing needs.
<p>(i)	Citing an organization as an author 
<p>If the author is an organization or a government agency, mention the organization in the signal phrase or in the parenthetical citation the first time you cite the source. The reference may look like, according to the American psychological association (2000) reading is ………….
<p> If the organization has a well known abbreviation, include the abbreviation in brackets the first time the source is cited; and then Use only the abbreviation in later citations. Look at the following example. 
<p>a)	First citation: Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD, 2019). 
<p>b)	Second citation: (MADD, 2019)

<p>(ii)	Citing two or more works – authors.
<p>When your in-text citation includes two or more works, say authors, order them the same way they appear in the reference list, separated by a semi-colon. For example, (Benard, 2017, Harlow, 2015)  
<p>(iii)	Citation involving authors with the same last name.
<p>To prevent confusion, use first initials with the last names for example (E. Johnson, 2018, L. Johnson, 2019) 
<p>(iv)	Citing two or more works by the same author in the same year
<p>If you have two sources by the same authors in the same year, use lower case letters (a, b, c,) with the year in the in-text citation. For example, research by Daft (2017a) illustrated that ……... 
<p>(v)	Citing a work by two authors 
<p>If you are citing a work by two authors, name both authors in the signal phrase or in the in-text citation each time you cite the work. Use the word “and” between the authors’ names within the text and use the ampersand in the parentheses or in-text citation. For example, research by Wegener and petty (2019) supports …………. or it may appear like, research support that…………. (Wegener and petty, 1994)
<p>Citing a work by three to five authors
<p>If you are referencing a work written by three to five authors; list all the authors in the signal phrase or in-text (in parentheses) the first time you cite the source. For example, (Kernis, Cornell, Sun, Berry and Harlow, 2019) …………….
<p>In subsequent citations, only use the first author’s last name followed by “et al” In the signal phrase or in parentheses (in-text). For example, (Kernis et al, 2019). This may appear like, Kernis et al, (2019) reading is ………Or it may appear like, reading is…… (Kernis et al, 2019) in et al; et should not be followed by a period. 

<p>Citing six or more authors 
<p>If you are citing or referencing a work written or done by six or more authors use the first author’s name followed by et al. in the signal phrase or in parentheses (in-text). For example, Harris et al, (2000) argued that …………, It may also appear like, quotation refers to the process of acknowledging…….. (Harris et al, 2001) 
<p>Citing unknown author
<p> If the work does not have an author, cite the source by its title in the signal phrase or use the first word or two in the parentheses. Titles of books and reports are italized or underlined; titles of articles and chapters are in quotation marks. For example, a similar study was done of students learning to format research papers (“using APA”, 2001).
<p>Note in the rare case the “anonymous” is used for the author; treat it as the author’s name. For example, (Anonymous, 2001). In the reference list, use the name anonymous as the author.
<p>Citing indirect source (secondary source) 
<p>If you use a source that was cited in another source, name the original source in your signal phrase. List the secondary source in your reference list, and include the secondary source in the parentheses (in-text). For example, Johnson argued that ……… (As cited in Smith, 2003, P.102).
<p>Note: when citing the material in parentheses (in-text), set off the citation with a comma, as above.
<p>Citing electronic sources 
<p>Electronic documents are cited in the same way as any other documents by using author-date style. For example, Kenneth (2018) explained ……

<p>Citing unknown author and date 
<p>If no author or date is given, use the title in your signal phrase or the first word or two of the title in the in-text (parentheses) and use the abbreviation “n.d” (for “no date”). For example,
<p> Another study of students and research decisions discovered that students succeeded with tutoring. “Tutoring and APA” (n.d)
<p>Summary or paraphrase. 
<p>If you are paraphrasing an idea from another work, you only have to make reference to the author and year of publication in your in-text reference. But an APA guideline encourages you to also provide the page number (although it is not required). For example, 
<p>According to Kerlinger (2004), APA style is a difficult citation format for first-time learners. APA style is difficult citation format for first time learners (Kerlinger, 2004, P. 199)
<p>Citing/referring a book with one author
<p>In citing a book with one author, consider the following general format. 
<p>a)	In-text citation (paraphrase) 
<p>(Author’s surname, year)

<p>Example, 
<p>(Franks, 2005)

<p>b)	In-text citation (Quotation)
<p>(Author’s surname, year, and page number) 

<p>Example,
<p>Franks, 2005, P. 148)


<p><span>REFERENCES </span></p>
<p>When referencing, consider the rules in series below.
<p>Author’s surname, first initial. Second initial. Year. Book title: subtitle. Place of publication: publisher. 
<p>Consider the following example. 
<p>Franks, A. (2005). Introduction to communication: Listening skills.  New York: Longmans.
<p>Reference List Citation 
<p>This is a list of all sources used in your research, books, journals, and appears at the end of your paper. 
<p>Your research paper, book, journal articles ends with a list of all the sources cited in the text of the paper. Here are rules for this reference list (APA).
<p>i)	Start a new page for your reference list. Centre the title, references, at the top of the page.
<p>ii)	Double-space the list 
<p>iii)	Start the first line of each reference at the left margin; indent each subsequent line five spaces (a hanging indent)
<p>iv)	Put your list in alphabetical order. Alphabetize the list by the first word in the reference. In cases, the first word will be the author’s last name, where the author is unknown, alphabetize by the first word in the title, ignoring the words a, an, the.
<p>v)	For each author, give the last name followed by a comma and the first (and middle, if listed) initials followed by a period.
<p>vi)	Italicize the titles of works; books, internet documents, news papers as well as the title and volume numbers of journals and magazines.
<p>vii)	Do not italize titles of parts of works such as articles from newspapers/essays, poems, short stories or chapter titles from a book/chapter or resections of an internet document. 
<p>viii)	In title of non-periodicals (books, websites, reports, poems, essays, chapters etc), capitalize only the first letter of the first word of a title and subtitle and all proper nouns (names of people, places, organizations, nationalities). 
<p>ix)	If more than one place of publication is listed, give the publisher’s home office. If the home office is not given or unknown, choose the first location listed.




<p>Citing from different source 
<p>a)	Citing books 
<p>Book citation in APA style generally requires author name, publication year, work title, publication city and publisher.
<p>Consider the following general book format. 
<p>Pollan, M. (2006). The omnivore’s dilemma. New York: Penguin group.

<p>Two or three author 
<p>For example; 
<p>Bell, C. and Colin, A. (2014). Mastering English grammar. London: Sage publications.  
<p>b)	Articles in print periodicals 
<p>In APA periodical citation, authors are named by their last name, followed by initials; the publication year goes in parentheses and is followed by a period. The title of the article is written in sentence-case, so only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized. The periodical title is written in title case and then followed by the volume number which with the title is italicized or underlined. 
<p>Author, A.A., author, B.B. and author C.C. (year). Title of article: title of periodical. volume number (issue number). pages.
<p>c)	Magazine 
<p>In APA magazine citation, consider the following format
<p>Author, J. (Year, month). Title. Time, volume number. Page number. 
<p>For example 
<p>Wozik, J. (2000, November). TV makes a tool-close call. Time, 20, 70-71.
<p>d)	Article in a news papers 
<p>Unlike other periodicals, P. or PP should precede page numbers for a newspapers reference in APA style. Single pages take P. (P.B2), and multiple pages take PP (PP.C1, C3-C4).
<p>For example;
<p>Schulz, S. (2005, December 28). Calls made to strengthen state energy policies. The country today, PP. 1A, 2B.

<p><span>Writing essays</span></p>
<p>An essay is a short piece of writing on a particular subject especially one done by students as part of the work for the course. It is also a short literary composition on a particular theme or subject, usually in prose and generally analytic, speculative or interpretative. An essay focuses or sticks mainly on the single subject. For example, one can write an essay on the importance of   water conservation, union day, the importance of working hard in studies etc.
<p>In essay writing, there are four writing styles; these include narrative, expository, argumentative and descriptive writing.

<h3><a name="nwr"></a></h3>

<p><span>Narrative writing </span></p>
<p>In a narrative essay, you tell a story often about a personal experience, but you also make a point. So, the purpose is not only to tell an entertaining tale but also show the reason for the story and the importance of the experience.


<p><span>ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF NARRATIVE ESSAYS</span></p>
<p>i)	Plot
<p>This refers to a series of incidents that are related to one another. What happens in a story? In the story what happens includes five stages, exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution.
<p>a.	Exposition 
<p>This is usually in the beginning of the story, where the characters, setting and conflict (problem) are introduced.
<p>b.	Rising   action
<p>This is the part of the story where the conflicts develop, in which the suspense and interest builds.
<p>c.	Climax 
<p>This is the turning point or most exciting moment of a story in which the main character comes face to face with the main conflict and a change happens.
<p>d.	Falling action 
<p>This is the stage in which all the loose ends of the plot are tied up, the conflict and climax are taken care of in this part of the story and the suspense is eased.
<p>e.	Resolution 
<p>This is the stage where the story comes to a reasonable ending and the outcome is resolved. 

<p>ii)	Setting; this entails the time and place of the action of a story, where and when it happens. 


<p>iii)	Characters. 
<p>These are people, animals or imaginary creatures that take part in a story. Characters may take different types such as protagonist, antagonist, dynamic, static characters and their characterization in general.
<p>iv)	Theme. A theme is a single idea in a work of art. It is a central concern of any story. A theme consists of the messages, which are the important lessons, morals or teachings we gain from looking closely at the characters actions as well as the events and outcomes of the story. 
<p>v)	Dialogue. It is a conversation between characters, usually set off by quotation marks to indicate a speaker’s exact words. 
<p>vi)	Point of view. This is the perspective or advantage point from which a story is told.
<p>vii)	Sensory details. These are words and phrases that help readers see, hear, taste, feel, or smell what the author is describing. 
<p>viii)	Non-fiction. This is writing that presents and explains ideas or that tells about real people, places or events.
<p>ix)	Fiction. It is a narrative writing that is invented or imagined. 
<p>x)	Audience; are those for whom a piece of writing is intended.
<p>xi)	Transition; are words or phrases that help to make smooth connections between parts of a text.
<p>xii)	Autobiography; this is the story of the writer’s own life, told by the writer.
<p>xiii)	Biography; it is the life story of a person told by someone else.
<p>xiv)	Conflict; this is the main problem or struggle between different forces in a story; it keeps the action moving forward. Conflict can be external or internal.
<p>a)	External conflict; this is the struggle between the character and an outside force; that means another characters or group of characters, or nature.
<p>b)	Internal conflict; this is the struggle within a character’s mind which happens when a character must deal with opposing thoughts or feelings. 

<p>Look at the following narrative 
<p>The manager, the leader.
<p>The following excerpt is a narrative essay about a manager who was a great leader. Notice the intriguing first sentence that captures your attention right away.
<p>Jerry was the kind of guy you love to hate. He was always in a good mood and always had something positive to say, when someone would ask him how he was doing, he would reply, if I were any better, I would be twins. He was a unique manager because he had several waiters who had followed him around from restaurant to restaurant. The reason the waiters followed jerry was because of his attitude. He was a natural motivator. If an employee was having a bad day, Jerry was there telling the employee how to look on the positive side of the situation.
<p><span>ACTIVITY 6.1 </span>
<p>1. In your own, write a short narrative about what you fear most and answer the following questions.
<p>a)	What is the about of your narrative?
<p>b)	What is the plot of your narrative?
<p>c)	What is the theme of your narrative?
<p>d)	Who are the interlocutors (characters)?
<p>e)	What is the conflict of your narrative?

	<h3><a name="ewr"></a></h3>
<p><span>Expository writing </span></p>
<p>Expository writing is writing that has a purpose of explaining and informing. In other words, expository writing is about providing information to the reader about a particular topic or subject, the purpose of expository writing differs from creative writing or persuasive writing; the purpose is merely to inform i.e. to provide information. Expository essays take many forms including how-to (or process), classification, definition, cause and effect and compare and contract.
<p>Study the following example of expository writing.
<p>Example 1 
<p>This morning at 9.00am, a school bus collided with a car at the intersection of Jones and heard streets. There were no injuries on the school bus, but medical personnel performed checks on each student and the driver before those students were transported to their schools. The driver of the car sustained slight, non-life-threatening injuries. He was transported to the local hospital. The accident is still under investigation at this time.
<p>Example 2 
<p>Advances in science and technology have made the use of “green” energy possible. In place where climate conditions permit, people are able to use solar energy or wind energy for power. Solar energy is the use of sunlight for energy and power. Human beings are able to harness the energy of the sun by installing solar panels on their homes or businesses. People have also found ways to harness the power of the wind by using wind turbines to capture wind energy. Both of these forms of “green” energy are being used more and more. 
<p>Examples 3
<p> The school science fair was a success again in this year. We had 15 teams participating and they all had amazing projects. Each team consisted of two students who designed a science experiment to test a hypothesis, created a display of their experiment and results, and presented their display to their judges. The winners this year are Sarah jones and Mark Gordon, who hypothesized that students get into less trouble in the classroom on days when it is sunny outside. The judges were very impressed with their data  collection methods, which included asking teachers to share information on how many students earned stars at the end of each day, they correlated this information with their own data about the weather-sunny, cloud or rainy. 
<p><span>Activity 6.2</span></p> 
<p>1.	Write an expository text (4-5 paragraphs) on one of the following subjects or topics.
<p>i.	What effect does technology have on relationships?
<p>ii.	How to treat severe allergic reactions.
<p>iii.	How do video games affect children?
<p>iv.	What are the positive and negative aspects of materialism?
<p>v.	Explain how the internet has had a positive effect on communication?
<p>vi.	Why do couples break up?

	<h3><a name="dwr"></a></h3>
<p><span>Descriptive writing</span></p>
<p>The primary purpose of descriptive writing is to describe a person, place or thing in such a way that a picture is formed in the readers mind. Capturing an event through descriptive writing involves paying close attention to the details by using all of your five senses. Teaching students to write more descriptively will improve their writing by making it more interesting and engaging to read. 
<p>However, a descriptive essay is a short paper which is all about describing or summarizing a topic.
<p>Characteristics of a descriptive essay
<p>i.	Good descriptive writing includes many vivid sensory details that paint a picture and appeals to all of the readers’ senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste when appropriate. 
<p>ii.	Good descriptive writing often makes use of figurative language; such as analogies, similes, personification and metaphors to help paint the picture in the readers’ mind. 
<p>iii.	Good descriptive writing uses precise language. General adjectives, nouns and passive verbs do not have a place in good descriptive writing. Use specific adjectives and nouns and strong action verbs to give life to the picture you are painting in the readers’ mind. 
<p>iv.	Good descriptive writing is organized. Some ways to organize descriptive writing include, chronological (time), spatial (location), and order of importance. When describing a person, you might begin with a physical description, followed by how that person thinks, feels and acts. 
<p>Examples of descriptive essay/writing 
<p>Study the descriptive essay examples to better understand each type listed below. A descriptive essay can describe any of the following.
<p>i.	Human essay
<p>It is much harder to tell about a person. Overall, such task would mean telling about the appearance, actions, behaviours, mood and qualities of the chosen individual occupation. 
<p>Consider the following example of a human descriptive essay.
<p>My uncle Jack 
<p>My uncle Jack is a very interesting person, uncle jack is calm, kind and at the same time cheerful person. He knows how to find a common language with everyone. He never raises his voice and says harsh words; and my uncle has a terrific sense of humor and knows how to tell great funny stories. 
<p>He understands well the technology. The only time when is better not to disturb an Uncle Jack-when he is busy. He works in the service centre. He pairs mobile phones, laptops, and digital equipments. Uncle jack is usually polite with everyone. He is always friendly to me, gives a lot of time, shows and explains everything.
<p>He says he loves to communicate with young people, because their minds are full of fresh ideas. I like the character of my uncle. I’m glad that he often comes to visit us and we visit him, the conversation with him is very interesting and informative. 

<p>Activity 6.3 
<p>1.	What are the six (6) descriptive features of Uncle Jack?
<p>2.	What other techniques can you use to describe a person?

<p>ii.	Place essay 
<p>A good description of a “place” helps to explain what makes it so different from other “place” and can give a good guide as to where it is located. A description can be divided into two parts the physical features and the human features.
<p>a)	Physical features; are those things that occur naturally such as mountains, rivers, soil, wildlife, climate etc.
<p>b)	Human features; are those that involve people, such as roads houses, farm lands, jobs or occupations and industry.
<p>When describing places, such as in the image below, it is not enough to simply say there are houses. Appropriate vocabularies should be used to give an indication of how many houses there are, what the houses are built of and whether many people live there, or just a few.
<p>Some of these appropriate vocabularies can be summarized as follows;

<table>
	<tr><th><span>Features</span></th><th><span>Physical features/meaning </span></th></tr> 

<tr><td> •	Relief </td><td>•	Shape of the land; for example, mountains, flat, steep, sloping.  </td></tr>
<tr><td> •	Landforms</td><td>•	For example, mountain, valley, cliff, beach, bay, river meander.  </td></tr>
<tr><td> •	Drainage</td><td> •	For example, rivers, streams or ditches. </td></tr>
<tr><td>•	Soil </td><td>•	For example, fertile or infertile.  </td></tr> 
<tr><td>•	Climate </td><td>•	For example, warm, wet, tropical, polar etc </td></tr> 

</table>
<br>

<p>Again observe the following vocabularies summarized below.
<table>
	<tr><th><span>Features</span></th><th><span>Physical features/meaning </span></th></tr>
<tr><td> •	Settlement population </td><td>The most common settlement sizes are; from small to large, hamlet, village, town, city) etc.</td></tr>

<tr><td> •	Houses </td><td>Their destiny building material, and if they are detached, semi-detached or terraced.</td></tr>

<tr><td> •	Land use </td><td>For example, urban or rural, residential or forest.</td></tr>

<tr><td> •	Occupations </td><td>How people make their living</td></tr>

<tr><td> •	Transport & communication </td><td> Roads, railways, port etc.</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>In descriptive writing, the writer does not tell the reader what was seen, felt, tested, smelled or heard. Rather, he describes something that he experienced and through his choice of words, makes it seem real. In other words, descriptive writing is vivid, colorful and detailed.
<p>Look at the following example of a place descriptive writing.
<p>Barcelona 
<p>Barcelona is my favourite city. It is in the north-east of Spain on the coast and it is very big. It has got beaches cathedrals and museums. You can see Gaudi’s architecture and other many fascinating things in it.
<p>Activity 6.4
<p>1.	Identify the four (4) features of Barcelona 
<p>2.	Write a text of three (3) paragraphs describing the city of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania.

<p>iii.	Describing an event 
<p>If you are describing an event, you will need to write your paragraphs in chronological order. This is contrary to when we are writing about a person or a place where we need to order paragraphs so that we start off in a general manner and then write more specific details later.
<p>Consider the following example of describing an event.
<p>My most memorable event
<p>Throughout my life I have had numerous memorable events. The memorable times in my life vary from being the best in my life and some being the worse. Either way, these memories have become milestones that I will remember forever, which is the day of my gradation. This day is the most memorable because of the enjoyment I had, when I received my high school diploma. I can remember this day like it was yesterday. My uncle came into my room at seven o’clock in the morning telling me, “rise and shin it was time to get up”. 
<p>I opened my eyes and started to stretch, wishing it was just a dream, but of course it was not!  I was extremely tired from staying up late the night before, because I was so anxious for the big day. 
<p>Activity 6.5 
<p>1.	Considering the example above, write three to four paragraphs describing your own event.
<p>2.	How do we describe an event? 
<p>Argumentative writing 
<p>Argumentative writing is also referred to as persuasive writing. The function of an argumentative writing (essay) is to show that your assertion (opinion, theory, hypothesis) about some phenomenon or phenomena is correct or more truthful than others. The art of argumentation is not an easy skill to acquire. Many people might think that if one simply has an opinion, one can argue it successfully, and these folks are always surprised when others do not agree with them because their logic seems so correct.
<p>Argumentative writing is the act of forming reasons, making inductions, drawing conclusions, and applying them to the case in discussion.
<p>The operation of inferring propositions, not known or admitted as true, from facts or principles known, admitted or proved to be true. It clearly explains the process of your reasoning from the known or assumed to the unknown. Without doing this, you do not have an argument, you have only an assertion; an essay that is just your unsubstantiated opinion.
<p>Notice that you do not have to completely prove your point. You only have to convince reasonable readers that your argument or proposition has merit, that it is somehow more accurate and complete than competing arguments. 
<p>Argumentative essays are often organized in the following manner.
<p>1.	They begin with a statement of your assertion, its timeliness, significance, and relevance in relation to some phenomenon.
<p>2.	They review critically the literature about that phenomenon.
<p>3.	They illustrate how your assertion is better (simpler or more explanatory) than others, including improved (i.e. more reliable or valid) methods that you used to accumulate the data (case) to be explained. 
<p><p>An argumentative essay is thus an essay in which you take a position on a controversial issue.

<p>How to write an effective argument essay. 
<p>In order to create or write an effective argument essay, one should consider the following important aspects. 
<p>1.	Choose an appropriate, focused topic; example, death sentence should be activated now days. 
<p>2.	Explore and decide your position for this topic.
<p>3.	Predict opposing arguments. 
<p>4.	Consider your audience and occasion 
<p>5.	Decide on which points you will argue.
<p>6.	Decide on which points you will refute in the concession.
<p>7.	Write a thesis that is focused, arguable and opinionated; for example, if every US citizen had a safe traveler card, airlines could screen for terrorists more effectively than they do now, and avoid procedures that single out individuals sorely on the basis of race.
<p>8.	Offer evidence. Offer evidence that effectively supports the claims through evidence personal experiences. In this instance, you are allowed to use the 1st personal point of view – I, me etc; to briefly give the personal evidence, and then return back to 3rd person point of view. For example, they, him/her, he/she, it, itself, themselves (formal academic writing). Likewise, 1st person point of view is a personal narrative. It can be appropriate in a formal academic essay only when giving a specific personal experience as a form of argumentative evidence. 
<p>9.	Consider the experiences of others 
<p>10.	Consider facts 
<p>11.	Consider statistics from current reliable sources. 
<p>12.	Consider hypothetical examples and testimony from authorities and experts. 
<p>13.	Analyse the evidence for effectiveness. Select which of all the gathered evidences you will use.
<p>14.	 Highlight and annotate your evidence; this will help you decide which parts of your evidence are strongest, and therefore appropriate for your essay.
<p>15.	Decide what pieces of evidences you would like to quote directly.
<p>16.	Summarize and paraphrase the other piece of evidence.
<p>Revising an argumentative essay 
<p>In revising an argumentative essay, one should 
<p>a)	Rethink the essay by; 
<p>i.	Evaluating the purpose, thesis, audience etc. 
<p>ii.	Arguments in the body paragraphs.
<p>iii.	Style, clarity and evidences. 

<p>b)	Edit the essay; 
<p>i.	Spelling 
<p>ii.	Pronunciation 
<p>iii.	Mechanics 

<p>c)	Holistic approach. 
<p>-	Read it again and again. 
<p>After looking all these ways on how to create or write an argumentative essay, one should turn it and share it with others.
<p>Things to remember in an argumentative essay. 
<p>•	Argue logically, and avoid fallacies.
<p>•	Use appropriate tone – the writer’s voice and not the spoken voice.
<p>An example of argumentative writing. How will you contribute to your learning team?
<p>Through the last few positions I have held, I had the opportunity to receive feedback on my performance and noted several recurring themes. I have high standards for quality of work and an ability to coach team members, ensuring that everyone is working at the same level. I am quick to adapt to and integrate with new or existing new environments. This is partially due to the fact that I am approachable and quickly earn the trust of those that I work with. I am resourceful but also constantly looking to expand my knowledge through reading, experimenting and training. 
<p>I am naturally inclined to take on leadership roles; however, I am just as comfortable as a contributing team member. I am confident that I will be able to leverage these assets, along with those learned to enhance the experience of my learning team. 
<p>Activity 6.6 
<p>Give 4 to 5 paragraphs of argumentative writing on one of the following topics.
<p>1.	Education should be free for everyone 
<p>2.	Internet access must be limited to students 
<p>3.	Young people must have a right to choose when it comes to military. 
<p>4.	Each student must have a right to pick only those disciplines he/she is interested in.
<p>5.	Alcohol usage should be controlled.
<p>6.	Should court proceedings be documented for television?
<p><p>Kind of essays
<p>The listed below are three different types of argumentative essays.
<p>i) 	A complete argumentative argument. The term complete argument, also referred to as complete formal argument, refers to an argument where the symbols representing the propositions or predicates are stated and definitions of these symbols or predicates are also stated (if needed). A complete argument is an argument that is stated or presented such that;
<p><p>a)	One can see all the propositions in the argument.
<p>b)	All the propositions in the argument are numbered.
<p>c)	It is noted what kind of purpose all the propositions have (premise, inference or assumptions).
<p>d)	All inferences are stated, it is stated from what they follow and what kind of inference it is.
<p>Here is an example of argument 
<p><p>1.	 The earth exists (premise) 
<p>2.	 If the earth exists, then the moon exists (premise) 
<p>3.	 If the moon exists then the moon is round (premise)
<p>Thus 4. If the earth exists, then the moon is round (2, 3) 
<p>Note that it is not necessary to state the definitions of the propositions or predicates. If the argument is complicated and uses predicate logic, then it is wise to define the terms before presenting the propositions. 
<p>i)	Longer argumentative essays. If there are issues that need or require more research and more time to conduct, then this is where an ordinary argument essay becomes longer and more detailed. 
<p>ii)	The five-paragraph essay. A very common method for writing an argumentative essay is the five-paragraph approach; but take not that there is no standard in writing an essay. The five paragraph method consists of; 
<p>a)	An introductory paragraph
<p>b)	Three supporting evidences i.e. body paragraphs; that may include discussion of opposing views and 
<p>c)	A conclusion

<p><span>Writing Official Letters</span></p>
<p>Rules for writing formal letters.
<p>In English there are a number of conventions that should be used when writing a formal or business letter. Furthermore, you should try to write as simply and as clearly as possible and not to make the letter longer than necessary. Remember not to use informal language, like contractions. Consider the following rules/aspects when writing an official letter.
<p>1.	Your address; the return address should be written in the top right-hand corner of the letter. This is also known as sender’s or writer’s address. 
<p>2.	Date; this is written on the right, and on the line below after the sender’s address.
<p>3.	The address of the person you are writing to.
<p>The inside address should be written on the left, starting below your address, i.e. below sender’s address.

<p>4.	Salutation or greetings.
<p>For example;
<p>i)	Dear sir or madam, 
<p>If you do not know the name of the person you are writing to, use this. It is always advised to try to find out a name, to know whether male or female; so that you can use one, whether Dear sir or Dear madam.

<p>5.	The heading of the letter (in short); the heading of the letter includes everything that precedes the content of your letter. It is a subject line; heading of the formal letter is usually written in short format. For example REF: APPLICATION FOR A TEACHING POST.

<p>6.	The main body (message) of the letter. Skip one line after the heading and begin writing/typing the body of the formal letter. This is the main part of the letter, keep in mind the rules outlined above regarding brevity and coherence. It is better to use short, clear and logical paragraphs to state your business.

<p>7.	Ending/ closing a letter
<p>In ending the letter, use words such as;
<p>i.	Yours faithfully; if you do not know the name of the person, end the letter this way.
<p>ii.	Yours sincerely; if you know the name of the person, end the letter this way. Generally you should always close with a positive sign-off; such as thank you, sincerely or respectfully etc.

<p>8.	Your signature; sign your name (writer’s signature). It is written a line interval below the ending/closing of the letter. 
<p>9.	Your names (writer’s names- in full); If you think the person you are writing to might not know whether you are male or  female, put your little in brackets after your name(s). Your position can also be indicated after a name if any.
<p>However, these rules for writing formal letter act as parts of an official letter.
<p>Content of a formal letter
<p>•	First paragraph. 
<p>The first paragraph should be short, and state the purpose of the letter-to make an enquiry, complain, request something etc.
<p>•	The paragraph or paragraphs in the middle of the letter should contain the relevant information behind the writing of the letter. Most formal letters are not very long, so keep the information to the essentials and concentrate on organizing it in a clear and logical manner, rather than expanding too much. Again, use evidence and persuasive reasoning to justify your main point.

<p>•	Last paragraph
<p>The last paragraph of a formal letter should state what action you expect the recipient to take – to refund, send you information, etc. the last paragraph is best known as closing paragraph, the closing paragraph should restate the point of the letter and most important, include a call to action. A call to action is a passage that compels your reader to do something. Ask yourself what do I want my reader to do right after reading this letter?
<p>Examples of calls to action.
<p>-	Please call me at (phone number…) 
<p>-	Email me at (email address….) at your earliest convenience.

<p>Would you kindly allow us to visit your Ngorongoro conservation authority area on 26th November, 2018 to see how the crater was formed and to see wild animals in the crater as well as to visit and see Olduvai George area. 
<p>We have been learning about Tanzania natural resources in our general studies lessons. Our tutor told us that your conservation authority area has several natural resources, such as Ngorongoro crater, wild animals and Olduvai Gorge which attract many people to visit your area. I think we will learn better about natural resources and their contribution to the national income if we visit your Ngorongoro conservation authority area. 
<p>We hope that you will let us come on the date we proposed or on any other date of your convenience.

<p><span>WRITING MEMOS</span></p>
<p>Memos are used within organizations to communicate everything from routine details to complete proposals and reports. Memos are often only a few short paragraphs, but they can be much longer, depending on their purpose. A memo is a short or an abbreviation for MEMORANDUM. 
<p>Typical uses of memos 
<p>The typical uses of memos include the following.
<p>i.	To inform others about new or changed policy, procedures, organizational details etc. 
<p>ii.	To announce meetings, events, changes etc.
<p>iii.	To present decisions, directives, proposals, and briefings. 
<p>iv.	To transmit documents (internal) 
<p>v.	To share information or services from another person or group within your organization.
<p>vi.	To serve as a reporting tool for a site inspection, business trip or research or test results.

<p>Memo format 
<p>i)	To: (who gets it) 
<p>ii)	From: (who sent or wrote it) 
<p>iii)	Date: (when it was sent/written) 
<p>iv)	Heading (Re:), this is  a subject line or subject i.e. what it  is about
<p>v)	Body. Conveys the message; it however, consists of three parts, the introduction, main point and close. 
<p>Important things to consider while writing a memo.
<p>While writing a memo, consider the following important aspects/things.
<p>1.	Concise. Make your sentences, paragraphs, and overall memo as brief as focused as possible.
<p>2.	Clear. Get your purpose straight before you start, then plan what you want to say and in what order. Use your memo layout to help your readers i.e. headings, bulleted list, and white space as appropriate.
<p>3.	Direct. Speak directly to your readers as you would in person or on the phone. Do not pad your ideas with unnecessary details. Think of what questions your readers wants answered, and then answer them.
<p>4.	Clean. Reread, revise and proof read. 

<p>Some organizations however, have a standard, pre-printed forms for memos in which the organization’s name and logo are present at the top with spaces provided for filling in the name (s) of the memo recipients(s), the name of the memo’s author, the date and the subject of the memo. When formality is needed, the titles of the recipients and sender should be included n the header. Except for very informal situations, memos should be typed. If you do not have a pre-printed memo form, you can create your own.
<p>Rules of memos
<p>Like most forms  of writing memos come with so many rules, instructions and suggestions that it is easy to forget a few. Since we have already the aspects/ways of how to write a memo, let us take a moment to look at these rules in practice.
<p>While writing over the memo, pay special attention to the key features of a memo. Ask yourself the following questions.
<p>•	Is it addressed to the right audience?
<p>•	Does the subject line accurately convey its contents?
<p>•	Does it anticipate and address potential objections?
<p>•	Is it formatted clearly and consistently?
<p>When considering each memo’s main text, pay close attention to the structure. The opening paragraph should restate the memo’s purpose indicated in the subject line. Subsequent paragraphs should build on this opening statement and explain the memo’s purpose in detail. 
<p>Unnecessary information should be removed and word choice remains straight forward and professional. 
<p>Consider the following memo example. 
<p>To: All staff
<p>From: The manager
<p>Date: may 27, 2018 
<p>Re: in appropriate use of time on Google micro games.
<p>It has come to my attention that many in the office have been spending time on the Google homepage micro games. This memo is a reminder to use your work hours for work. Please let every of us be careful with the use of company time. 
<p>Thank you, 
<p>The manager

<p>Writing letters to the newspaper’s editor
<p>A letter to the editor, sometimes abbreviated LTTE or LTE; is a letter sent to a publication about issues of concern from its readers. Usually letters are intended for publication; in many publications, letters to the editor may be sent either through conventional mail or electronic mail.
<p>Letters to the editor are most frequently associated with newspapers and news magazines. However, they are sometimes published in other periodicals such as entertainment and technical magazines. 
<p>People often write letters to newspaper editors to voice their opinions. The letters chosen for publication usually are only a sample of the total letters. 
<p>How to write a letter to the editor 
<p>The following are the tips for writing letters to the editor
<p>i)	Keep it brief and to the point
<p>Letters to the editor should be concise-typically newspapers have a word limit of about 250 words (about 3 paragraphs). Editors are less likely to print long letters.
<p>ii)	Make your letter timely
<p>Tie the subject of your letter to a recent article, editorial or column. Use that article as the hook for communicating your message.
<p>iii)	Localize your letter 
<p>Lend credibility to your letter by noting your professional experiences in the community that prompted you to write on this topic.
<p>iv)	Use “levels of thought as a method for organizing your letter. 
<p>The framework institute, a non-profit communications research organization, adopts the position that people reason on the basis of deeply held moral values. Those moral values are part of a hierarchical process for how people think about ideas and issues, which they refer to as “levels of thought”. You can use levels of thought to structure your letter to the editor. Begin your letter with a big idea or value (level one) that provides a context for understanding the more specific details (levels two and three) of your communication.
<p>v)	Be mindful of the tone of your letter 
<p>The tone of your letter can either support or over power the substance of the message you are trying to communicate. Therefore, choosing and controlling tone is an important element of your communication.
<p>vi)	Write about good news, not just bad 
<p>Thank the paper (when appropriate) for its positive and accurate coverage of the problem (an issue). Or thank a policy maker for being a champion; for example, for infants and toddlers in the state or community.
<p>vii)	Include your name, title, address, and day time phone number.
<p>Editors like to confirm that the letter was actually written by the person whose name is on it. Also be sure to provide your professional title and affiliation as it lends credibility to your letter. 
<p>viii)	Consider other news papers for publication 
<p>Many metropolitan areas for example, have free weekly community news papers that go to thousands of homes; many cities also have newspapers for specific ethnic group. Consider sending your letter to the editors of these other widely read publications. 
<p>ix)	Focus your message on one key point 
<p>Although there may be man elements for example, to the infant-toddler issue you want to address, you will have more success of your editorial is focused and easy to understand.
<p>x)	Review the pages of your letter.
<p>By reading the pages (letter), you can get a sense of what is being covered and what is not being addressed. You can also get an idea of the types of publications that the editor publishes.
<p>xi)	Always be courteous and polite
<p>This is included if you are writing a letter of praise. 
<p>xii)	If you are writing a letter of complaint keep in mind that you cannot rant or vent.
<p>xiii)	You have to have carefully constructed sentences. 
<p>xiv)	Be concise and end your point as soon as you have stated its importance.
<p>xv)	In the end, mention how their newspaper was a useful thing to the public.

<p>The citizen. 
<p>Subject: content of newspaper article.

<p>Dear Mr. Mahesh;
<p>I am Mohamed, a citizen and regular reader of your newspaper and I have been reading it for nearly the past nine years. The main reason I am writing this letter is to say that initially, I was very happy with the type of articles you were publishing, and your selection of writers and stories. However of later, the newspaper’s style and preference has changed. I am writing on behalf of several other readers as well, to urge you to revert back to your original culture and tone. 
<p>Now days, the supplements of your newspaper contain more advertisements for exorbitant brands and meaningless peddling of irrelevant goods. You have also started to lay more stress on the glamorous side of town instead of delivering the emphatic and hard-hitting stories you were once famous for.
<p>The main reason your newspaper got famous was because of its view of the society, you used to publish more number of articles related to social issues which were taken care of at that time. But now, we hardly see one or two articles in the newspaper which are related to social issues. We think it is better if you concentrate more on social issues than publishing commercial and useless news in the paper. We as readers of your newspaper urge you to refocus your attention on the matters that really matter.
<p>Thanking you 
<p>Mohamed

<p>Dear editor, 
<p>I wish to bring to your attention, the growing level of corruption among municipal officers. The municipal corporation of the city, already infamous. Its style of working is now faced with the new problem of growing level of corruption with its officials. It has become almost impossible to get any work done without bringing the officers. Everyone from top to bottom is openly asking for money.
<p>The role of anti-corruption is also mysterious in this regard. They seem to be the only people not knowing about this and often fail to take any steps even after receiving the complaints, they ignore it and are also involved with the officers. I think they are all doing this together.
<p>It is a shame that people who are willing to pay the bribe and extra amount when they are entitled to the services and can take steps in this regard.
<p>It is immediately required that inquiry be set up, and the image of the corporation is improved to install people’s faith in this system. As a number of people are regular readers of your newspaper, I think it is better if you publish something about this issue.

<p><span>Writing Curriculum Vitae </span></p>
<p>When applying for certain position from organizations in the country as well as jobs internationally, you may be required to submit a curriculum vitae rather than a resume. A Curriculum Vitae or CV includes more information than your typical resume, including details of your education and academic achievements, research, publications, awards, affiliations and more.
<p><p>How long should a CV be?
<p>A good Curriculum Vitae should ideally cover not more than two pages and never more than three. The aim is to ensure that the content is clear, structured, concise and relevant. Using bullet points rather than full sentences can help to minimize word usage. 
<p>What to include in a curriculum vitae? 
<p>A curriculum vitae, commonly referred to as CV, is a longer (two or more pages), more detailed synopsis than a resume. Your CV should be clear, concise, complete and up-to-date, with current employment and educational information.
<p>The information that you include in Your CV will depend on what you are applying for, so be sure to incorporate the most relevant information to support your candidacy in your CV. 
 <p>The following are the information or things that should be included in the curriculum vitae.
<p>1.	Personal details and contact information 
<p>Most CVs start with contact information and personal data but take care to avoid superfluous details, such as religious affiliation, children’s names and so on.
<p>2.	Education and qualifications
<p>Take care to include the names of institutions and dates attended in reverse order, PhD, masters, undergraduate etc.
<p>3.	Work experience/employment history 
<p>The most widely accepted style of employment record is the chronological curriculum vitae. You career history is presented in reverse date order, starting with the most recent achievements, and responsibilities are listed for each role. More emphasis/information should be put on more recent jobs. 
<p>4.	Other skills/experience 
<p>Include computer skills, foreign language skills, communication skills and any other recent training that is relevant to the role applied for.


<p>5.	Hobbies and interests 
<p><p>Include your most area of interest and hobbies. For example, watching some important TV programmes, listening gospel music etc.
<p>6.	Referees 
<p>A referee is someone who the employers can contact if they wish to ask about or clarify something about you or your personality, job experience, skills and attributes. Therefore it is important that you state the contact details of referees whom you list on your CV and ensure that they are people who will say good things about you, if you wish to receive the job offer.
<p>Provide details of two or three referees that you can trust, to give an honest and positive account of you, so that your potential employer can quickly and easily ask about you. Include their names and phone numbers.
<p>It is recommended that you do not ask a friend or family member to be a referee, employer will often ask questions that require an objective response and may feel that a family member or friend will not respond honestly.
<p>When you are approaching someone to be a referee, be respectful and give them plenty of information. It is also sensible to give you referee, a copy of your CV and keep them up to date with your job search progress.

<p><span>Writing Reports </span></p>
<p>Some academic assignments ask for a “report,” rather than an essay, and students are often confused about what that really means.
<p>Likewise, in business, confronted with a request for “report” to a senior manager, many people struggle to know what to write. 
<p>Confusion often arises about the writing style, what to include, the language to use, the length of the document and other factors. 
<p>This part aims to disentangle some of these elements and provide you with some advice designed to help you to write a good report.

<p>What is a Report?
<p>In Academic Context, there is some overlap between reports and essays and the two words are sometimes used interchangeably, but reports are more likely to be needed for business, scientific and technical subjects and in the work place. 
<p>Where as an essay presents arguments and reasoning, a report concentrates on facts. 
<p>Essentially, a report is a short, sharp, concise document which is written for a particular purpose and audience. It generally sets out and analyses a situation or problem, often making recommendations for future actions. It is a factual paper and needs to be clear and well-structured. 
<p>Report writing is also an essential skill in many disciplines. You should develop effective report writing skills at schools, colleges and universities because it is highly likely you will be writing reports in the workplace.
<p>A report is a formal written document used to provide concise information on a specific subject. It can be used to communicate the results of an experiment, inform on the progress of a project or to make recommendations as stated above. 
<p>An effective report is an accurate presentation of information. It should be objective, concise and structured to guide the reader through the main points.
<p>The sections contained in a report will depend on the report type and specific task requirements. It is your responsibility to find out what to include in your report. However, a basic report should include the following sections. 
<p>1.	Preliminary parts 
<p>This section includes the following;
<p>a)	The title page and acknowledgements. 
<p>The title page should include the Title of the report, who it was commissioned by (writer), and the date.  the title page, clearly describes what the report is about. 
<p>b)	 Executive summary or abstract.
<p>The abstract or executive summary provides a summary of the main objectives, research methods and the findings of the report. It also identifies what action is required. Although the abstract is located at the beginning of the report, it is usually written last as it is a summary of the whole report.  It states the problem, how it was investigated, what was found, and what the findings mean.
<p>c)	Table of contents. 
<p>The table of contents shows the structure of the report. It includes a list of major and minor sections of the report. 


<p>2. Introduction
<p>This section captures the reader’s attention. It states the aims and objectives of the report, the problem or situation that prompts the report, and identifies what the report intends to achieve. You should also include definitions, research methods and background history (if relevant).
<p>3. Body of the report 
<p>The body of the report includes the following;
<p>(i)	Methodology; the methodology explains what you did and how you did it. It could be the material used in an experiment, the subjects involved in a survey or the steps you took in a report. 
<p>(ii)	Results or findings; this is where you present the findings from your experiment, survey or research project.  
<p>(iii)	Discussion; this is where the facts or evidences are presented and discussed.
<p>(iv)	Recommendations; this describes a clear course of action. The recommendations should demonstrate your professional competence in a specific situation and be clearly aligned with your conclusions.
<p>4. Conclusion
<p>The conclusion provides implications from the content of the report, for all reports, you have to ensure that the conclusion that you draw are supported by the evidences that you find/observed. 
<p>5. Supplementary parts 
<p>This section contains the following;
<p>i)  References
<p>This is the part where you acknowledge all the sources used in the report. Referencing is how you clearly and consistently acknowledge all the information sources you have used in your work. When you include references, you can demonstrate your understanding of the topic, support your ideas with research and avoid accusations of plagiarism. 
<p>ii)	Appendices.(if any) 
<p>The appendix contains additional graphical, statistical or other supplementary material. Each item should be clearly labeled (e.g. appendix 1) and referred to in the report. In brief, appendices refers to any information, graphs, charts, tables or other data referred to in your report, but not included in the body. 

<p>Things/ways to consider when writing a report. 
<p>There are styles/ways through which one need to consider when writing a report. These styles include the following.
<p>i)	Use formal and simple language.
<p>ii)	Use consistent and appropriate format.
<p>iii)	Ensure the separate parts of your report stand out clearly.
<p>iv)	Use short informative headings and dub-headings. 
<p>v)	Allow generous spacing between the elements of your report.
<p>vi)	Use dot points/numbers/letters to articulate these elements. 
<p>vii)	Use white space to de-clutter the page (s)
<p>viii)	Use tables and figures, graphs, illustrations, maps etc. for clarification. 
<p>ix)	Proof read to ensure accuracy.
<p>A report is also a document that presents information in an organized format for a specific audience and purpose. Although summaries of report may be delivered orally; complete reports are almost in the form of written documents.
<p>Characteristics of effective report
<p>Effective reports are understood by the readers as the writer intended and they influence the readers to act as the writer desired. The writer’s objectives are most likely to be achieved if they correspond with the needs and objectives of the readers.
<p>An effective report is empathetic, accurate, complete, concise and clear. Above all, an effective report presents information ethically.
<p>A report is again a logical presentation of facts and information. it is a result of the research, analysis and investigations which is present in written form. It is the basic tool on which decisions can be based. 
<p>The information present in the report is needed to evaluate progress and plan future actions. Reports provide feedback to an organization to guide future course of action. 
<p>A report is a communication form of someone who has some information to someone who needs   that information.
<p>An effective report makes the information as clear, convenience and accessible as possible. 
<p>Reports vary widely in their purpose; they also differ with the type of audience they are written for.

<p>Types of Reports
<p>Reports are of different types; the following are the different types of reports. 
<p>1.	Informal reports
<p>These are usually in the form of a person to person communication. These reports do not follow any format and informally conveys the required information. 
<p>2.	Formal reports 
<p>These are prepared in a prescribed form and are presented in the proper way to the prescribed authority, they can be a statutory.
 
<p>3.	Periodic or routine reports
<p>These are presented at routine intervals in the normal course of business. The time/period could be annually, monthly, weekly or even daily. Generally, these reports are mere statements of facts. They do not go with a recommendation or opinion. For example, progress report, monthly sales report etc.
<p>4.	Special reports 
<p>They are related and generated for a single occasion or situation. They deal with non-recurrent issues. An individual or committee is appointed to investigate the situation and present its findings. They give suggestions to the management to take decisions. For example, project report, feasibility study report, first information report (F.I.R) etc.
<p>5.	Informative reports 
<p>These presents facts and information related to an issue or situation; for example, a report presenting sales figures for a quarter.
<p>6.	Interpretive reports 
<p>These analyses the facts, draws conclusions and recommendations to solve the problem. For example, if the report delves into the causes of low sales during a particular period, it becomes an interpretive or analytical report. 

<p>7.	First information reports (F.I.R)
<p>These are required when there is burglary accident, theft, fire, building, collapse etc. which is available immediately after the incident occurs, for example;
<p><p><p><p><p>-	What happened? 
<p><p><p><p>-	When did it happen?
<p><p><p>-	Who noticed it? 
<p><p>-	What steps were taken immediately after it?
<p>-	Who were all present on the scene? etc. 
<p>A responsible person who is present on the spot of the incident prepares it. It is submitted to any office authority for information and further actions; for example, regional office, police station etc. the F.I.R also states the extent of damage on casual estimation. 
<p><p>8.	Progress reports 
<p>These give information about the progress of a student, an employee or a project. These reports can be prepared as comments, or filled in standard format. A bridge construction, a road laying project, an employee training programme, a student’s progress throughout a year etc. can be presented in a progress report.
<p><p>9.	Inspection reports 
<p>Inspection reports are prepared after an inspection is complete. The supervisor, auditor or any other expert in the field can prepare this report. Inspection reports become necessary when you have to find out the following;
<p>a)	The quality of goods, plants and machinery.
<p>b)	The quality of work done 
<p>c)	Deviation from present standards 
<p><p>d)	The presence of required people
<p>e)	The accuracy of financials 
<p><p>f)	The inventory status 
<p>g)	Adherence to rules and procedurh)	Timings are being followed. 
<p>Printed forms can be used to record the comments; or the inspector can use their own techniques of report writing. Inspection reports can be prepared on a routine basis or after a surprise check.
<p><p>10.	Performance reports 
<p>Performance reports are usually prepared for recording the performance of our employee, and deciding his compensation, special incentives, promotion etc. the immediate boss usually does it. A second appraiser may also be present if needed to avoid partiality. Performance appraisal may also be present if needed. This depends on the organizational policies. After reading the performance appraisal report, an employee can get feedback about his performance in the the organization. 
<p>11.	Feasibility Report 
<p>A feasibility report can be prepared on the following situations. 
<p>-	When an organization/individual proposes to launch a product.
<p>-	Before entering a market
<p>-	To open a new shop 
<p>-	Before venturing into a market segment 
<p>-	Before buying a new expensive machine 
<p>-	Before planning expansion of man or machine requirements.
<p>-	To evaluate the financial viability of a proposal. 
<p>A feasibility report can help on making Go/No go decision. It is invaluable for decision makers when they have a major project in their hand. People who grant loans and funds for new projects, normally decide whether or not to go ahead, on the basis of the feasibility report. They normally cover all types of feasibilities; for example, location feasibility, financial feasibility, marketing feasibility, and technical feasibility. 
<p>12.	Survey reports 
<p>These are written after a survey. it could be a; 
<p>-	Market survey 
<p>-	Institutional survey 
<p>-	Location survey 
<p>-	Product survey
<p>-	Competitor survey 
<p>-	Student survey and,
<p>-	Executive survey 
<p>A survey can be done for many reasons, the reasons may be academic or business, a specific person can conduct a survey for a specific reason or an organization could sponsor it for expansion of data bases. A survey report can help you to update the existing statistics. A survey is normally carried out with the help of questionnaires. Survey report includes also what we call book report (book in report form).
<p>13.	Press reports 
<p>Press reports are scripts for publication in newspapers or other periodicals. They are read by millions of people from all walks of life and of all age groups. Press reports are scientific messages, published to convey different opinions to the reading public; the topic can range from. 
<p>-	Political issues 
<p>-	Health 
<p>-	Economics 
<p>-	Foreign affairs 
<p>-	Education 
<p>-	Entertainment 
<p>-	Social issues 
<p>-	Current affairs 
<p>-	Administrative matters and,
<p>-	Religious matters etc.
<p>They cover development under different government regimes, the speeches of important proceedings, the programs of an election manifesto, changes in financial, stock and commodity markets, and thousands of other events that take place in the complex world.
<p>14.	Letter reports 
<p>Letter reports are a very simplistic approach to relaying information. you may use this format when out lining the terms of a discussion or informal agreement or as an introduction to a large more complex document. 
<p>15.	Memo reports  
<p>Memos are the standard form of brief report, typically used for things such as brief announcements, and reminders or updates. They are used internally. a memo may be issued to note a job promotion, new hire, a termination or new internal protocol. It may also be used to issue group thanks or acknowledgements, issue a reminder or provide an update on a project of events.
<p>16.	Proposal reports 
<p>A proposal is a variation of problem solving reports. A proposal is a document prepared to describe how one organization can meet the needs of other. Most governmental agencies advertise their needs by issuing requests for proposal or report fund proposal (RFP). The RFP specifies a need and potential suppliers, who prepares proposal reports telling how they can meet the needs.


<p>17.	Functional reports
<p>These classifications (reports) include accounting reports, financial reports, marketing reports and a variety of other reports that take their designation from the ultimate use of the report. Almost all reports could be included in most of these categories.
<p>Although authorities have not agreed on a universal report classification, these report categories are in common use and provide a nomenclature for the study and use of reports.
<p>18.	Internal/external reports 
<p>Internal reports are reports which travel within the organization. External reports travels outside the organization, such as annual reports of organizations are prepared for distribution outside the organization. 
<p>19.	Short or long reports 
<p>These are the confusing classification. A one page memorandum is obviously short and a twenty page report is clearly long. But where is the dividing line? Bear in mind that a report becomes longer or what you determine as long, takes on more characteristics of formal reports. 
<p>Long reports are more formal, which includes annual reports, earning reports, audits reports, analytical reports and academic reports. Each of these report formats, typically include introduction, table of contents, executive summaries, chapters or sections and an appendix. These are often used to deliver complex information, convey the results of studies or surveys or to demonstrate research findings. Long reports are also referred to as final reports. Short reports on contrary takes on more characteristics of informal reports.
<p>-	Other forms of reports include committee reports, meeting reports, technical reports, business reports, Problem determining reports, Fact finding reports etc.
<p>Study the following sample report
<p>Tuition at the athletic conference colleges for 2018 – 2019 
<p>By Jane Doe 
<p>Introduction 
<p>College students are almost concerned about tuition costs, which may guide their choice of a college. As a college student in Athletic, I was curious about the tuition at private, undergraduate colleges in the state. How do the tuitions compare? How does my college (Gustavus Adolphus College) compare to the others in the state? For this report, I have analyzed the 2018-2019 tuition for thirteen private, undergraduate colleges in the athletic conference colleges (ACC). The athletic conference colleges sponsor championships in 25 sports (13 for men and 12 for women). the colleges in the conference are members of the national collegiate athletic association (NCAA) division III, which means that financial aid is based only on need rather than athletic ability. 
<p>The 2018-2019 tuition ranged from $13,340 to $23,469 with the median tuition $16,353. The Gustavus tuition of $17,480 is above the median, although not the highest of the athletic conference colleges.
<p> Body of the report
<p>•	Methods
<p> The 2018- 2019 tuition for all colleges and universities are published by the national centre for education statistics (NCES), appearing on line at http://nces.ed.gov/. The NCE is a collection and analysis of educational data in the United States and other countries. The 2018-2019 tuition for athletic conference colleges was obtained from this website and is summarized in the table in the appendix.
<p> Being the 2018-2019 tuition, measured in dollars; I used a table to display the distribution of 2018-2019 athletic conference colleges’ tuition. Because of the presence of outliers, I measured the center and spread of the distribution with the median and inter quartile range (IQR) respectively. 
<p>•	Results 
<p>The distribution of 2018-2019 athletic conference colleges’ tuition was skewed towards high value (figure in appendix). The median 2018-2019 athletic conference colleges’ tuition was $16,353 with an inter quartile range of $2,115. There were two colleges which had a high tuition. Carleton, $23,469 and Macalester, $20,688.
<p>•	Discussion
<p>About three fourths of the colleges had 2018-2019 tuition between $15,000 and $19,000 with the middle half of the tuitions between $15,365 and $17,480. Half of the 2018-2019 athletic conference colleges’ tuition was less than $16,353. Carleton and Macalester had the highest tuitions, while Concordia and St. Mary’s were lowest. My college, Gustavus has lower 2018-2019 tuition than only three of the athletic conference colleges; Carleton, Macalester and St. Olaf.
<p>Abstract (Executive Summary).
<p>This report aims at discussing and highlighting on the impact of tuition fee towards students’ choice of colleges or universities. This is again meant to show the way students are being affected by this high tuition among some colleges at the athletic conference colleges for 2018-2019. 
<p>However, the 2018-2019 tuitions for all colleges and universities are published by the national centre for education statistics (NCES), appearing online at http://nces.ed.gov. Likewise, it is found that the 2018-2019 athletic conference colleges’ tuition was generally running toward high value (cost), though very few Universities are seen with at least low cost. This then affected many students to pursue their education. To address this phenomenon, the respective government should ensure reasonable tuition at different athletic conference colleges, to enable all students have an access to pursue their education from these colleges.   

<p>Conclusion 
<p><p>Basing on the findings of this report, tuition from different colleges and universities differ; and this has influenced students’ choice of the colleges. Some colleges or universities have highest tuition, this is evident as from the distribution of 2018-2019 athletic conference colleges’ high value, again the median 2018-2019 athletic conference colleges’ tuition was $16,353, with an IQR of $2,115
<p>Recommendations 
<p>The government should take part in monitoring and ensuring the running of different universities and colleges. This should be aligned with checking of high tuition among these colleges and universities. On the other hand, colleges and universities should reduce high tuition values; since it limits equal access to education.

<p><span>Writing Posters </span></p>
<p>A poster is any piece of printed paper designed to be attached to a wall or vertical surface. typically posters include both textual and graphic elements, although a poster may be either wholly graphical or wholly text. Posters are designed to be both eye-catching and informative. Posters may be used for many purposes. They are frequent tools for;
<p>a)	Advertisements, particularly of events, musician and films.
<p>b)	Propagandists 
<p>c)	Protestors and other group trying to communicate a message. 
<p>d)	Posters are also used for reproductions of artwork, particularly famous works and are generally low-cost compared to the original artwork.
<p>How to make a poster 
<p>Making a poster is a great way to advertise an upcoming event, tell people your point of view or event, Whether you draw your poster by hand or you design it digitally and print it out; It is important to think about how your poster will read from both up close and far away. Consider the following aspects.
<p>i)	Once you have picked your basic design, choose a font, colour and embellishments that will help viewers instantly know what your poster is trying to say. Embellishments like symbols, graphics and glitter. 
<p>ii)	Have your main slogan or headline in the centre of the poster.
<p>iii)	Write a list of the elements you need to include in your poster. Think about what you really want to say as well as any important information you need to include. 
<p>iv)	Get a large piece of paper, poster board or another backing material. A thicker poster will look more professional but you can make a poster out of almost anything. You can use high quality foam board from a craft store. 
<p>v)	Sketch out your design on a regular piece of paper.

<p><span>Writing advertisements</span></p> 
<p>Advertisement is a notice or announcement in a public medium promoting a product, service or event, or publicizing a job vacancy. Advertising is a marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, non-personal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea.
<p>Sponsors of advertisements are typically businesses wishing to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations, in that an advertiser pays for and has control over the message. It differs from personal selling in that the message is non-personal, i.e. not directed to a particular individual. 
<p>How is advertising communicated? 
<p>Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including:
<p>i)	Newspapers
<p>ii)	Magazines 
<p>iii)	Televisions 
<p>iv)	Radios 
<p>v)	Outdoor advertising 
<p>vi)	Direct emails 
<p>vii)	New media, such as search results, blogs, social media, websites or text messages.
<p>The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisements or advert for short.

<p>TYPES OF ADVERTISEMENTS 
<p>1.	Public service advertisements 
<p>Unlike traditional commercials, public services advertisements (PSA) are primarily designed to inform and educate, rather than sell a product or service. PSA’s traditionally appears on TV and Radio; but are also heavily promoted online. 
<p>2.	Print advertisements 
<p>Print advertisements includes
<p>i)	Periodical advertising i.e. newspapers, magazines etc. 
<p>ii)	Brochures, leaflets, handouts and point of sale advertising
<p>iii)	Direct mail advertising.
<p>either of the techniques mentioned above can be incorporated into direct mail. It simply means that your printed pieces are mailed direct to the consumer.
<p>3.	Broadcast advertisements 
<p>A mass-market form of communication including television and radio, broadcast advertising has until recently, been the most dominant way to reach a large number of consumers. 
<p>4.	Social media  advertisements 
<p>Businesses can also create different target groups and send adverts on social media platforms to users that would be most interested in their products and services, targeting options can include targeting based on geographical location, buying tendencies and other consumer behaviours.
<p>One effective method of placing social media adverts is known as retargeting, which focuses on website visitors that left without buying a product or signing up for some type of free offer like subscribing to a new letter. 
<p>Ways of Writing an Advertisement 
<p>1.	Write a well targeted headline; a good headline should catch the reader’s attention and make them want to read on. It might ask a question or inspire curiosity. It may refer to a specific problem, for example, “had another bad night’s sleep?” or it may appear to offer the solution to a problem. For example, “ever wanted to know the secret of a good night’s sleep? 
<p>Don’t overplay the actual message, people will feel let down if they read on and their expectations are not fulfilled. A headline will encourage people to read on if it offers a clear benefit. It could also be used to create a fear of missing out in the readers mind, for example, last few remaining.
<p>2.	Designing an advertisement; Use a clear design to convey your message, the way an advertisement looks, plays a big part in attracting and retaining the readers interest. Avoid small or complicated typefaces that are difficult to read. 
<p>Keep plenty of white spaces in the advertisement; avoid the temptation of saying too much. Ensure your contact details are clearly positioned. 
<p>3.	Write an advertising copy; use convincing copy to persuade your audience. the amount of text you include depends on the purpose and size of the advertisement. Businesses that want to advertise a sale might have a very limited amount of text accompanied by a headline and a picture of some of the items on offer.
<p>Consider the print quality of the newspaper or magazine. A small advert in a poor quality publication will be hard to read. 
<p>Note:
<p>i) 	A good copy draws attention to the benefits of the products or service, rather than focusing solely on the features. All readers want to know “what is in it for me?” 
<p>ii) 	If you are writing a lot of texts, it should follow on logically from the headline, build a convincing case and prompt a response from the readers. Back up any claims with facts. 
<p>iii) 	You should always write your advertisements with the reader/viewer- your potential customers in mind.
<p>iv)	Remember that businesses have a duty to ensure their advertising is legal, decent, honest and truthful.

 <p><span>QUESTIONNAIRE</span></p> 
<p>A questionnaire is a research instrument consisting of a series of questions (or other type of prompts) for the purpose of gathering information from respondents.
<p>Questionnaires have advantages over some other types of surveys in that they are cheap, do not require as much effort from the questioner as verbal or telephone surveys, and often have standardized answers that make it simple to complete the data. However, such standardized answers may frustrate users. Questionnaires are also sharply limited by the fact that respondents must be able to read the questions and respond to them. Thus for some demographic groups, conducting a survey by questionnaire may not be concrete.

 <p><span>TYPES OF QUESTIONNAIRES</span></p> 
<p>Questionnaires can be categorized into the following types.
<p>i)	Structured questionnaires 
<p>Structured questionnaires are based predominantly on closed questions, which produce data that can be analyzed quantitatively for patterns and trends. The agenda/issue is entirely predetermined by the evaluator and provides little flexibility for respondents to qualify their answers.

<p>ii)	Unstructured questionnaires
<p>Unstructured questionnaires, whilst still having a structured sequence and focus predetermined by the evaluator; are based on open questions, allowing respondents the freedom to answer in their own words and therefore to provide greater qualification in their response.
<p>iii)	Semi-structured questionnaires
<p>Semi-structured questionnaires take a mixed approach. It is a combination of unstructured and structured questionnaires. 
<p>Basic rules for questionnaire item construction.
<p>i)	Use statements which are interpreted in the same way by members of different subpopulations of the population of interest.
<p>ii)	Use statements where people who have different opinions or traits will give different answers.
<p>iii)	Think of having an “open” answer category after a list of possible answers. 
<p>iv)	Use only one aspect of the construct you are interested in per item. 
<p>v)	Use positive statement and avoid negatives or double negatives.
<p>vi)	Do not make assumptions about the respondents.
<p>vii)	Use clear and comprehensible wording, easily understandable for all educational levels.
<p>viii)	Use correct spelling, grammar and punctuation. 
<p>ix)	Avoid items that contain more than one question per item. For example, do you like strawberries and potatoes?
<p>Questions should not be biased or even leading the participants toward an answer.
<p>Why use questionnaires?
<p>Questionnaires are used for the following reasons 
<p>i)	To allow for feedback from a large number of respondents, where it is impractical to collect feedback using other more resource intensive methods.
<p>ii) 	To allow each respondent the opportunity to provide anonymous feedback on their experience. 
<p>iii)	Structured questionnaires for example, allow for the exploration of patterns and trends which help to describe what is happening in the learning and teaching context and provide a measure of respondents’ opinions, attitudes, feelings and perceptions about issues of particular concern to the evaluator. They also help to identify pattern and trends that lead to   further exploration using qualitative methods.
<p>iv)	Unstructured questionnaires allow for sufficient feedback that may provide insight into explanations for what is happening, participants’ opinions etc. they also allow for issues to emerge that are not necessarily foreseen by the evaluator.
<p>Strengths of questionnaires 
<p>a)	Questionnaires can be used to collect data quickly. 
<p>b)	Feedback is generally anonymous; which encourages openness and honest. 
<p>c)	All participants can be given the opportunity to provide feedback.
<p>Limitations of questionnaires 
<p>i)	Questionnaire could be interpreted differently by respondents. It can be difficult to design questionnaires to minimize this effect. 
<p>ii)	Data processing and analysis for large sample can be time consuming. 
<p>iii)	It can be difficult in motivating potential respondents to complete questionnaires. 
<p>iv)	While questionnaires are in expensive, quick and easy to analyse, often the questionnaire can have some problems, for example, unlike interviews, people conducting the research using questionnaires may never know if the respondent understood the question that was being asked. 
<p>v)	Also because the questions are so specific to what the researcher is asking, the information gained can be minimal. Often, Questionnaires give few options to answer; respondents can answer either option but must choose only one response. 
<p>vi)	Questionnaires also produce very low return rates; whether they are mail or online questionnaires.
<p>vii)	The other problem associated with return rates is that, often people who do return the questionnaires are those who have a really positive or a really negative view point and want their opinions heard. 
<p>viii)	People who are most likely unbiased either way, do not respond because it is not worth for their time.
<p>ix)	One key concern/problem with questionnaires is that there may contain quite large measurement errors. These errors can be random or systematic. Random errors are caused by unintended mistakes by respondent’s interviews and/or coders. Systematic error can occur if there is a systematic reaction of the respondents to the scale used to formulate the survey question. Thus, the exact formulation of a survey questions and its scale are crucial, since they affect the level of measurement errors.
<p>x)	Further, if the questionnaires are not collected using sound sampling techniques, often the results can be non-representative of the population; as such a good sample is critical to getting representative results based on questionnaires.

<p><span>Writing minutes </span></p>
<p>Writing meeting minutes can save time and money. Succinct minutes that capture the purpose of the meeting and its agreed outcomes are a record that can be referred back to and be used for follow up purpose later. Good minutes are concise and to the point, but at the same time they do not leave out critical information.
<p>Why writing minutes
<p>Writing minutes can take time and may seem like an unimportant task compared with getting on with “real work,” but in fact not taking meeting minutes can be costful in terms of both time and resources. If you do not take minutes you will find that your colleagues have different recollection from the meeting than you. They also may have different ideas about what was agreed. If there are no minutes, then important tasks will be forgotten or not achieved by the due date.
<p>Creating meeting minutes provides a written record of what was agreed at a meeting. Good meeting minutes tells people what was decided and what they need to achieve and by what date. When meeting minutes are received, it jogs memories about tasks that people need to do. If a task is not performed then you can refer back to the meeting minutes, you have no resources if an action was not carried out. In the worst case, if meeting minutes are not written you may end up having to repeat the meeting.
<p>In some instances, meeting minutes may be required for legal reasons. An example of this is where local bylaws require it for certain types of organizations. Also they may be required for disciplinary meetings with employees. Getting into the habit of taking meeting minutes is good practice. 
<p>What needs to be included in the meeting minutes?
<p>When you are writing meeting minutes, you need to include different kinds of information. you should include the reasons for the meeting, what it was about and where and when it was held. It is important to include a list of attendees – both their first and last names. If you are not sure you need to ask to make sure that you get the names right, otherwise your meeting minutes may be a source of irritation for attendees. If someone did not attend but it was important that they did, this should be included. For example, sometimes decisions cannot be made without a particular person being present.
<p>There are three other main items that should be included in your minutes.
<p>i.	What was achieved during the meeting 
<p>ii.	Decisions that were made at the meeting. Your minutes will serve as a written record that these decisions were made. 
<p>iii.	Any actions that were agreed. In this case you should include the action itself, who it was assigned to, and the date it should be completed by.
<p>Finally, if a follow-up meeting was agreed on, this should be mentioned. 
<p>Meeting minutes can therefore be defined as the written or recorded documentation that is used to inform people of what happened during the meeting and define the next step planned.
<p>How to write effective meeting minutes 
<p>As stated previously, to write effective meeting minutes, you should consider the following;
<p>i)	The names of the participants 
<p>ii)	Agenda items 
<p>iii)	Calendar or due dates 
<p>iv)	Actions or tasks 
<p>v)	The main points 
<p>vi)	Decisions made by the participants 
<p>vii)	Record; what are the most important points.
<p><p>viii) Future decision 
<p>ix) Documents, images, attached files. 
<p>Before the meeting however, you need to prepare the different topics to be addressed during the meeting; noting what you know about them in order to save time and to be able to focus on important topics during the meeting. If not, you might end up on the margins of the meeting being too busy taking notes. 
<p>Look at the following example of a meeting minute.

<p>Activity 6.15
<p>1.	Form a group through which you will select a chair person and secretary, then conduct a meeting on a certain topic and write its minutes.   
<p>Creative writing 
<p>Creative writing is writing that expresses the writer’s thoughts and feelings in an imaginative, often unique and poetic way. So in creative writing, the purpose is to express thoughts, feelings and emotions rather than to simply convey information.
<p>The word “creative” is defined in various ways. The following are just some of the definitions.
<p>a)	“The ability to create” 
<p>b)	“Imaginative” and,
<p>c)	“Productive”
<p>Characterized by expressiveness and originality. Creative writing is often defined as the writing of fiction, where the author creates events, scenes and characters, sometimes even the world.
<p>Creative writing is any writing that goes outside the bounds of normal profession.  Journalistic, academic or technical forms of literature typically are identified by an emphasis on narrative craft, character development and the use of literary tropes or with various traditions of poetry and poetics.
<p>Due to this looseness of the definition, it is possible for writing such as feature stories to be considered creative writing, even though they fall under journalism because the content of features is specifically focused on narrative and character development. 
<p>Both fictional and non frictional works fall into this category, including such forms as novels, biographies, short stories and poems. 
<p>Creative writing can technically be considered as any writing of original composition. In this sense, creative writing is a more contemporary and process-oriented name for what has been traditionally called literature, including the variety of its genres. 
<p>Creative writing is a composition on any type of writing at any time, primarily in the service of such needs as;
<p>1.	The need for keeping records of significant experience.
<p>2.	The need for sharing experience with an interested group and 
<p>3.	The need for free individual expression which contributes to mental and physical health.

<p>How does creative writing differ from other writing?
<p>i) 	The overall intent of creative writing is not to inform. It is to stir the emotions to elicit an emotional response.
<p>ii) 	Informative writing is primarily about imparting knowledge; creative writing is primarily about creating emotional effect and significance. 
<p>iii) 	Good creative writing however, uses the same kinds of writing that make for good informative writing, good argument and or good exposition. It is the writer’s skills in using these forms of writing that can turn any piece of writing into creative piece of writing.
<p>iv) 	A story teller’s narrative is designed to express the story teller’s feelings about some aspects of life and to engage the reader in those feelings. A poet uses events, images and people to deliver concentrated emotions. Dramatists and screen writers convey and stir emotions through action and dialogue. A magazine feature writer comments on real people and real lives to arouse our sympathy, delight, horror or concern.
<p>v) 	As stated before, all writings involve creativity since are selective and they are written from the writer’s perspective. Like informative writing, expositions (detailed statements or explanations) or instructions, creative writing does convey information even when we define it so broadly; indeed information is the basic component of all communication, no matter what kind.


<p>Creative Genres 
<p>A Genre is a word often used to describe categories or types of written text. Some of the more familiar genres of creative writing are;
<p>a)	Poetry of all kinds 
<p>b)	Short stories 
<p>c)	Novels, including westerns, romances, science fiction, detective stories, mysteries, fantasy etc. 
<p>d)	Stage play scripts 
<p>e)	Lyrics 
<p>Other genres that we may not think of as creative writing are;
<p>i) 	Magazine articles
<p>ii) 	Newspapers feature stories
<p>iii) 	Essays
<p>iv) 	Biographies
<p>v) 	Advertisements
<p>vi) 	Card greetings
<p>vi)	Book or articles on science, history etc. 

<p>Activity 6.16
<p><p>How is creative writing different from other kinds of writing?

	<h3><a name="fwr"></a></h3>
<p><span>Factual Writing </span></p>
<p>Factual writing deals with facts and everyday situations; such writing does not, by and large, call for an imaginative, personal or creative response.  
<p>Factual writing explains a series of events in a chronological, unbiased way that allows readers to gain information that is not influenced by the personal opinions of the writer or publisher.
<p>Examples of factual writing include local, regional, national and international news stories. Factual stories describe an event without using subjective descriptions or assuming that the reader feels a certain way about the event. 
<p><p>It is important to note that some factual writing only includes a description of one event. Other types of factual writing, called feature stories; describe a series of related events over a specified time period from the perspective of numerous people, place and things that are involved in the ongoing event, such as political campaigns.
<p>How to do with factual writing? 
<p>In order to do with factual writing, one should consider the following ways
<p>i)	Gather the facts 
<p>ii)	Write a summary about the text
<p>iii)	Organize it by asking the following important questions.
<p>a)	How? (punctuation, grammar, vocabulary)
<p>b)	Why? (Reasons that support what you write)
<p>c)	When? (time in which your facts can be traced) 
<p><p><p>d)	What? (What we have to pay attention)
<p><p>e)	Where? ( the society in which you are writing)
<p>f)	Who?  To make a factual writing, you can use the technique of writing a report about something that is true.
<p>Writing factual descriptions
<p>Things To consider when writing factual descriptions
<p>i) 	Steps. Factual description of a process or an event requires a step by step account of an activity, experiment and procedure.
<p>ii) 	Flow of ideas. The ideas should be systematically presented with important points coming first followed by not so-important points. Heading is an essential part of it and should be short and clear. 
<p>iii) 	Language
<p>The language used should be semi-formal in nature. Try to be simple, attractive and appealing. Also try not to show your linguistic ability. You should make your factual description in such a way that it shows your attention to detail and observation skills.
<p>iv) 	Make a note of tenses used in your description as most often this is the place where students find greater difficulties
<p>v) 	Content. In Content you need to observe the following;
<p>-	When did the event occur? Venue of the event. 
<p>-	Sequence of events/programmes
<p>-	Information about participants/guests/judges.
<p>-	Kind of organization, people responsible for programme/arrangements. 
<p>-	Results, if describing a contest
<p>-	Value points
<p>The content may be; 
<p><p>a)	PERSON based 
<p>•	Physical attributes
<p>•	Intellectual and emotional qualities.
<p>•	Other’s perception about him/her.
<p>•	Any other relevant trait of him or her by using point of an incident.

<p>b)	PLACE based
<p>-	Location
<p><p>-	Dimensions
<p>-	Special features about the place 

<p>c) 	OBJECT based 
<p>•	Physical description (colour, design, material used etc)
<p>•	Utility value 
<p>•	Special feature about the object
<p>Format of writing factual description
<p>You usually start writing factual descriptions by writing the TITLE at the centre and then following it with regular paragraphs. The factual descriptions would generally look like the following and for ease in organizing. It has been marked with areas so that you know how your content flows in the factual descriptions. 
<p>WASHING MACHINE
<p>A washing machine is a convenient appliance that is used for washing clothes. The automatic washing machine has a central drum that is used for holding the clothes. There is a dispensing tray, where the detergent and additives can be put in. the control panel has knobs which control the temperature and allow users to select different modes of operation. The drum also helps to dry clothes by spinning like a centrifuge machine.
<p>A washing machine is usually made of metal parts, but some of them are reinforced plastics. They may be front opening or top loading

						<h2>INTERPRETATION AND TRANSLATION</h2>
									
							</div>
							<br><br>



<p><span>The concept of translation</span></p> 
<p>Translation is in its simplest the process f changing words or text from one language into another. It is the communication of the meaning of the source-language text by means of an equivalent target-language text. 
<p>The English language draws a terminological distinction (not all languages do) between translating a written text and interpreting oral or sign-language communication between users of different languages; under this distinction, Translation can begin only after the appearance of writing within a language community. 
<p>A translator always risks in advertently introducing source-language words, grammar or syntax into the target-language rendering. On the other hand, such “Spill-overs” have sometimes imported useful source-language and loan words that have enriched target languages. Translators have helped to shape the very languages into which they have translated. 
<p>For example, the sentence “the complainant should be reimbursed with all the costs he incurred during the case” Is in English. As we write its Kiswahili equivalent, it will be “Mlalamikaji arudishiwe gharama zote alizotumia wakati wa kesi”.
<p>Another sentence “Ninampenda Mama yangu” in Kiswahili. If we write its equivalent English, it will be “I like my Mom”
<p>In translation, the source language (SL) is the language being translated from, it is the antonym of the target language (TL) which is the language being translated to. a part of the difficult in translating arises due to the Lexical gap and syntactical different between the source language and the target language, especially between two languages belonging to different language families.  
<p>In most professional setting, the source language is also the translator’s second language. 
<p>Back-translation is the process whereby a text that has been translated from the source language to the target language and then a second translator translates the translation back into the source language. The two source language texts-the original and the back translation- are then compared.
<p>A source language is a language which is to be translated into another language. it is a language from which a translation is made.

 <h3><a name="witim"></a></h3>
<p><span>Why is translation important? </span></p>
<p>i) Translation is important because people prefer their Native language; English is the most widely spoken language. But that is only if you take second language speakers into account, and therein lays the rub. Almost without exception people respond better to the language they grew up speaking.
<p>ii) Translation connects the Global economy; thus, there is a reason demanding for translation services. While English has been periodically crowned as “the language of global business,” translation and interpreting services remain a vital part of doing business around the world. 
<p>iii) Translation spreads ideas and information. What is the number one reason translation is so important? It allows ideas and information to spread across culture. in the process, translation changes history.
<p>iv)	Emerging markets. Emerging markets mean Emerging languages. English may be on top of the world now, but that does not mean it will stay that way forever. Other languages are growing in importance as developing countries take their places in the global economy and more of their citizen gain internet access. For example, most of the world’s web content used to be in English, that is no longer the case; and remember even people who speak English as a second language generally prefers to read, watch and shop in their first languages. 
<p>Consider the following examples
<p>a)	Arabic translators kept the ideas of ancient Greek philosophers alive throughout the middle ages. 
<p>b)	The bible has been translated into at least 531 languages. No matter what you believe, the impact on history is undeniable.   
<p>c)	Translation is helping sports teams and organizations overcome language barriers and transcend international boundaries.

	<h3><a name="totra"></a></h3>
<p><span>Types of Translation </span></p>
<p>There are various types of translation these includes the following 
<p>1.	General translation; the simplest type of translation, a general translation allows a translator quit a lot of lee way because its source material mostly uses layman terms and ordinary, everyday speech. There is no need to understand special terminologies and most translation work fall into this particular type. 
<p>2.	Legal translation; it is one of the more complex and complicated professional translation type. Legal translation is best described as the translation of treaties, contracts, and many other legal documents. A translation service is responsible for both understanding politico-legal and socio-cultural context behind a legal text, and translating it in such a way that a target audience with a different cultural/political/societal background could readily understand.
<p>Legal translation is the most complex translations and involves birth certificate translations and marriage certificate translations, translating contracts, agreements, treaties, memorandums, wills, and so on. A good translator needs to understand the various underlying context of the documents and that of the two regions or countries for which the documents are intended- the socio-cultural aspects, the politico-legal aspects as well.  
<p>3.	Commercial translation; commercial translation, sometimes called business translation, covers any sort of document used in the business world; such as letters. Company accounts, tender documents, annual reports, memos etc. often, commercial translations requires specialist translators with knowledge of terminologies used in the business world.
<p>This type of translation necessitates a translator to possess specialized skills like knowledge of business jargon and the industry to which the business belongs. The type of texts in the translation of commercial documents could include business correspondence. Sometimes, this could overlap with legal Translation if the company handles legal paper work.
<p>The translation of commercial documents is most often required for documents of the following types. 
<p>i)	Flyers, commercial pamphlets 
<p>ii)	Marketing studies, competition studies, reports on commercial actions 
<p>iii)	Commercial brochures, business plans etc. 
<p>iv)	Magazines, internal newsletters, miscellaneous publications,
<p>v)	Commercial packaging
<p>vi)	Job descriptions.
<p>Commercial documents for marketing and sales are intended to be convincing. The style used for commercial translations is very different from the one that would be used for financial translation or for the translation of technical documents.
<p>Closer to the translation of commercial websites, the translation of commercial documents is carried out by professionals who have good experience in both sales and marketing; Coming from advertising agencies or marketing departments, our commercial translation experts provide true added value when translating such documents. It is also called profit making, the whole sale translation, market, trade, and supplying translation. 

<p>4.	Administrative translation; administrative translation can mean many things, but in the context of translation, it merely refers to translating managerial texts used in different corporations, business and organizations. This translation type also overlaps with commercial translations but only in the sense that the vast majority of administrative translation can be considered commercial translation as well, but not all commercial translation are administrative in nature. 

<p>5.	Literary translation; as its name suggests, literary translation refers to translation done for literature; such as poems, plays, short stories and novels. Just as general translation is the simplest form and legal translation is the most difficult form, many people in the industry consider literary translation as the highest form of translation. The reason behind this is because literary translation goes beyond translation of a context; a literary translator must be proficient in translating humor, cultural nuances, feelings, emotions and other subtle elements of a given work. Conversely there are those who allege that literary translation is impossible as with the case of translating poetry, however, it  is there and possible.      

<p>6.	Certified translation; a certified translator may use their signature to authenticate official translations; these are usually documents which require legal validation and are thus referred to as “certified”. Certified translator often work in courtrooms as judicial translators or act in the capacity of legal expert as well as providing translations of civil status documentation, marital agreements, divorce settlements, deceases and wills for example.

<p>7.	Judicial translation; judicial translations not to be confused with legal or certified translation, refers to the task of translation undertaken in a court setting. Judicial translator specializes in translating documents such as letters, rogatory, minutes of proceedings, judgments, expert opinions deposition, minutes of interrogation sessions etc.

<p>8.	Scientific translation; as its name indicates, scientific translation deals with documents in the domain of science. Articles, theses, papers, congress, booklets, presentations, study report etc. 

<p>9.	Financial translation; financial or economic translation, of course, deals with documentation relating to the likes of financial banking and stock exchange activity. This also includes company annual reports, financial statements, financial contracts, financing packages and so forth. Financial translation is also called monetary translation.

<h3><a name="tmputr"></a></h3>
<p><span>The main principles underlying translation </span></p>
<p>In translating a text, some principles are involved. However, the following are the principles of translating a text.
<p>1.	Translation should use the full resources and vocabularies of the target language. In literary translation, some source language terms may be deliberately left in the original in order to provide the feeling of a foreign setting. However, such practice is not acceptable in the case of legal and technical translation. 
<p>2.	In many cases, there may not be an equivalent word or phrase in the target language for the given word or phrase in the source language. In such cases, the translator must translate the concept rather than the word or phrase. Ideas, not words should be translated. 
<p>3.	Translations should neither add any facts or features to the original nor omit them. In sum a translation should not sound like one it should sound like the original.

<p>Once upon a time there lived a lion in a forest. One day after a heavy meal, it was sleeping under a tree. After a while, there came a mouse and it started to play on the lion. Suddenly the lion got up with anger and looked for those who disturbed its nice sleep. Then it saw a small mouse standing trembling with fear. The lion jumped on it and started to kill it. The mouse requested the lion to forgive it. The lion felt pity and left it, the mouse ran away. 
<p>On another day, the lion was caught in a net by a hunter. The mouse came there and cut the net thus it escaped. Thereafter the mouse and the lion became friends. They lives happily in the forest afterwards.

<p>(ii) At the independence gathering on March 6, 1957; Nkrumah- new prime minister of Ghana-declared that Ghana’s independence was meaningless unless it was directly linked with the total liberation of the continent. This statement served as the corner stone of Ghananian foreign policy during Nkrumah’s tenure as leader of the country.  
<p>George Padmore became the official advisor on African affairs and was placed in charge of the bureau of African affairs whose task was to assist other national liberation movements on the continent in their efforts to win political independence. In April 1958, the first conference of independent African states was convened with eight nation-states as participants. This gathering broke down the colonially imposed divisions between north and south of the Sahara.
<p>In December later the same year, the first all-African people conference was held in Accra, bringing together 62 national liberation movements from all over the continent as well as representation from Africans in the United States. It was at this conference in December, 1958 that Patrice Lumumba of Congo became an international recognized leader of the anti-colonial struggle in that Belgian colony. 
<p>By 1960, the independence movement had gained tremendous influence throughout Africa; resulting n the emergence of many new nation states on continent the same year, Ghana became a republic and adopted its own constitution, making Nkrumah the president of the government.

<p>The concept of interpretation  
<p>Interpretation requires you to first understand the piece of text, language or idea and then give your explanation of it. Interpretation is the facilitation of spoken or signed language communication between users of different languages. It involves rendering a spoken or signed message into another spoken or signed language, preserving the register and meaning of the source language content. 
<p>Interpreters are employed in a multitude of setting including court, schools, medical facilities, social services as well as national and more. 
<p>The role of the interpreter involves making both the parties understand the contents of the speech or message; the interpretation can be consecutive or simultaneous.
<p>How to become an interpreter of a text or message? 
<p>In order to become an interpreter of a text, message or idea, you should consider the following.

<p>1.	Familiarize yourself with the contents of speech in more than one language. It should be understood that there are three different parties involved in the process. 
<p>These parties include; 
<p>i)	The speaker, who speaks in a foreign language
<p>ii)	The interpreter, who converts the foreign language speeches into local language which is understood by the third party/audience 
<p>iii)	The audience, who does not understand the speech. 

<p>2.	Learn language interpretation with an interpreter with ample amount of experience in both the domain as well as the language. It is always preferable to hand over the text of the speech to the interpreter before hand, so that necessary preparations are made in advance. The delivery of interpretation should be professional and the formation of the sentences has to be simple and accurate.

<p>3.	Become highly proficient in the chosen language. Once you have chosen language interpretation as your career, you have to build a very strong base in the source language, target language, and professional subjects. In order to take up interpretation as your career, one should know at least two languages thoroughly. One of the languages will be the source language and another will be the target language.
<p>An in-depth knowledge of both the language is very essential. It is important to take advanced courses in at least one second language. You should also take specific course in interpretation techniques as well as public speaking to help you in facing large public gatherings. 
<p>4.	Get a certificate in the field. This is the common most path; you should receive your certificate in the interpretation field. There are many programs which allow you to specialize in interpretation as part of studying for second language; for which certificates are offered at both undergraduate and graduate levels.
<p>5.	Get experience; while training is of paramount importance, there is no teacher like experience; so you should strive to get as many assignments as you can. This would help you in honing your skills and excelling as an interpreter. 
<p>Interpretation is the act or process of converting the spoken message concept or idea from one language to another language of equivalent spoken message; it can be done through acting, writing, critiquing etc. 
<p>It is the act of identifying or transmitting meaning from one language to another language

<p><span>Basic principles of interpretation.</span></p>
<p>1.	Interpret everything that is said; you may not summarize what is said nor add your own comments.
<p>2. You must be neutral; you may not take sides for either the interpreting user or the client or get involved in the matter; otherwise, you are impartial.  Also avoid sitting and talking with the interpreting user or client before or after the interpreting assignment, your neutrality as an interpreter can then be called into question.
<p>3. You must observe strict professional secrecy. Everything that is said in the interpreting discussion is secret. Everything said during the interpreting discussion is covered by confidentiality.
<p>4. Always interpret in first person. Interpreting in first person emphasizes your role as a neutral spokes person. 
<p>5. Prepare yourself; before an interpreting assignment, you should familiarize yourself with relevant terminologies and facts. Always have a dictionary, pen and paper on hand. Also be prepared for special conditions, such as if it concerns interpreting for children or in psychiatric services. Also ensure to have plenty of time before assignment begins.
<p>6. Avoid conflict of interest; if the client turns out to be a friend or relative of yours, you must inform the interpreting user of this. It is not permitted to interpret with a conflict of interest without the interpreting user’s consent. 
<p>7. Think about where you place yourself in the room. You, the interpreting user and the client should form a spatial triangle where the interpreting user and the client sit across from each other and have eye contact. This way you can also emphasize your role as a neutral spokes person.
<p>8. Take breaks if the discussion lasts a longtime; so that you do not get too tired and lose your concentration. You should take a break at least once an hour; you have the right to five minutes break per hour.
<p>9. Note and ask about what you do not understand. This enables one to understand and grasp what is being said and how to interpret it.
<p>10. Take notes and be particularly careful with names, figures and addresses. You may need to use dictionary or consult with somebody else. You are the language expert. But it is the customer who is the expert on the topic. 
<p>11. If you notice that parties do not understand each other, it is not your duty to comment on this in the discussion. They must discover these themselves. However, you should of course say if you do not understand what somebody is saying, then step out of the role and say “the interpreter does not understand”
<p>2.	After concluding an interpreting assignment, you can either turn over your notes to the customer or destroy them. For reasons of secrecy you may not save any notes. You must always observe strict professional secrecy. Everything said during the interpreting discussion is covered by secrecy.
<p>Challenges Facing Interpreters of Language
<p>Interpreting is one of the main components of language services, and there are many challenges interpreters face to promote understanding and facilitate communication. Linguistic and cultural challenges abound, despite being similar to translation, in that they both deal with transposing a source language to a target language, interpreting is more complex than translation. 
<p>There are more challenges interpreters face every time they are on the job. Most of these challenges not only affect new interpreters, but even highly seasoned professionals. These challenges include the following.
<p>1)	Knowledge of local culture; being an interpreter is very demanding. aside from a high level of proficiency in the source and target language, another of the challenges interpreters face is that they must be highly knowledgeable of the culture of different countries. 
<p>Even if one is a native speaker of Spanish, for example, the interpreter has to know the differences on how Spanish is spoken by people from different regions. Speakers will often use local idioms, slangs and jargons when they speak, so it is very important for an interpreter to know that.  
<p>Cultural awareness is another of the many challenges interpreters face; they will not be able to consult dictionaries and other references. When interpreting an interpreter listens to the speaker, analyze the message and reconstruct it in the target language immediately. 
<p>Interpreters rely not only in their excellent language proficiency, but also in their vast knowledge of the different cultures, the cultural connotations of the words spoken and how the language is expressed in a different culture. 
<p>2)	Lack of prepared materials; experienced professional interpreters normally go over conference material a day or two ahead of schedule. It is to prepare themselves for what will be discussed or tacked during the meeting. Doing so removes some of the stresses that are traditionally part of the job. 
<p>It will be a challenge for interpreters when they receive no or very little briefings about the conference and the speakers. One of the greatest challenges interpreters face is going into a situation ill-prepared. 
<p>Prepared materials coming from the conference host allows the interpreters to get familiar with the topic to be presented or discussed, the terminologies to be used and the background information about the speakers. It gives them time to do extra research if necessary to fully prepare for the scheduled work.
<p>Preparation matters in enabling interpreters to take on the job with higher confidence level. Thus, it is important for interpreters to ask some basic questions prior to the acceptance of the job. Such questions can focus on:-
<p>i)	The Subject matter and nature of the meeting.
<p>ii)	Venue and date.
<p>iii)	Technical conditions i.e. equipment, visibility and interpretation booths. 
<p>iv)	Language regime, source and target languages.
<p>v)	Availability of texts and documents.
<p>vi)	Interpreting mode.
<p>vii)	Team leader, booth mates and team members.

<p>3)	Difficulty in hearing the speaker, this is one of the biggest challenges interpreters face. This situation can have two origins. One is that the audio equipment is malfunctioning. The other reason could be a problem with the individual speaker. 
<p>This is particularly true when doing consecutive, simultaneous or face-to-face interpretation. Sometimes it is unavoidable that the audio equipment the speaker is using suddenly fails or the speaker might speak too softly for the interpreter to hear.

<p>What difficulties do interpreters of a language encounter?

<p>Exercise 7.7
<p>1 (a) Translate the following text in English into Kiswahili

<p>An appreciation of these points can only be gained through a detailed study and knowledge of a particular language and its various forms and expressions.

<p>(b) Bantu is the name of a large category of African languages; it is also used as a general label for over 400 ethnic groups in sub- Saharan Africa, from Cameroon across central Africa and eastern Africa to southern Africa. These people share a common language family sub- group, the Bantu languages and broad ancestral cultural traditions. Those traditions historically underlay increasing diversity of culture and customs.
<p>Within colonized regions, Bantu languages may be more or less naturally intelligible, but Bantu languages as a whole are as diverse as indo- European languages.
